  abstract = {Postmodernity and economic globalization incite countries, regions, and cities to compete for investments, consumers, and resources. In aspiring for a new position in this global market, cities utilize new urban practices that lead them to rediscover and reinvent identities and traditions. In Rio de Janeiro, the mythical dimension of the South Zone is inseparably incorporated to its identity. In evaluating the history of the imagery linked to the beaches and the projects for the waterfront, one may observe a social construction of a reality that is marked by a continuous redesigning of symbols but also by a discontinuity in the history of urban interventions. Although tourism and marketing continually praise the waterfront as a fundamental factor in the image of the city, a continuous public management process never really existed. The city managers must understand the beaches, the waterfront, and development along the shoreline as important resources in a continuous process of social construction of a reality that should not only address their images as commodities but should treat them as inseparable from the city's daily public and social lives.},

  abstract = {Interrupted time series (ITS) analysis is a valuable study design for evaluating the effectiveness of population-level health interventions that have been implemented at a clearly defined point in time. It is increasingly being used to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions ranging from clinical therapy to national public health legislation. Whereas the design shares many properties of regression-based approaches in other epidemiological studies, there are a range of unique features of time series data that require additional methodological considerations. In this tutorial we use a worked example to demonstrate a robust approach to ITS analysis using segmented regression. We begin by describing the design and considering when ITS is an appropriate design choice. We then discuss the essential, yet often omitted, step of proposing the impact model a priori. Subsequently, we demonstrate the approach to statistical analysis including the main segmented regression model. Finally we describe the main methodological issues associated with ITS analysis: over-dispersion of time series data, autocorrelation, adjusting for seasonal trends and controlling for time-varying confounders, and we also outline some of the more complex design adaptations that can be used to strengthen the basic ITS design.},

The RFS also seeks to propagate wider benefits such as local economic development and aiding farms to shift to more environmentally friendly methods. The analysis indicates that the headline target is likely to be met comfortably. Producers that have received support under the RFS have performed better than nonbeneficiaries and positive assessments of the business training and advice received are recorded. However, the purported linkages with wider benefits are difficult to establish. Trade-offs between the competitiveness agenda of stimulating growth and meeting some wider policy goals are apparent.},

  abstract = {Gender is both an archetypal and adaptive dimension of the urban condition and, thus, remains a key moving target for planning practitioners and scholars alike. This is especially true of women's growing, if not revolutionary, involvement in the economy. A familiar exception is the trip linking work and home, which has been consistently and persistently shorter for women than men. That said, new reports suggest that the gender gap in commuting time and distance may have quietly vanished in some areas. To explore this possibility, I use panel data from the American Housing Survey to better measure and explain commute trends for the entire United States from 1985 through 2005. They overwhelmingly indicate that differences stubbornly endure, with men's and women's commuting distances converging only slowly and commuting times diverging. My results also show that commuting times are converging for all races, especially for women, and women's trips to work by transit are dwindling rapidly. Thus sex continues to play an important role explaining travel, housing, and labor market dynamics, with major implications for planning practice.},

Instead, the direct employers of low wage workers operate in far more competitive markets that create conditions for non-compliance. We examine this evolution in employment and its implications for public policy in the US, discuss the factors driving fissured employment and sketch its main features and outcomes. We then look at the traditional methods used for labour standards enforcement in the US and discuss why they are poorly suited to address fissured workplaces. Finally, we survey how public policies might better address the realities of the modern workplace, including efforts in this regard by the Obama administration.},

Regarding urbanization outcomes, the evidence reviewed supports the convergence hypothesis in broad terms, but with ample evidence of hybridity, resulting in urbanization with Chinese characteristics. The article concludes with a call for a more balanced approach to urban policy interventions in China, whereby existing spatial planning perspectives are complemented by market-based perspectives.},

Precarious work constitutes a global challenge that has a wide range of consequences cutting across many areas of concern to sociologists. Hence, it is increasingly important to understand the new workplace arrangements that generate precarious work and worker insecurity. A focus on employment relations forms the foundation of theories of the institutions and structures that generate precarious work and the cultural and individual factors that influence people's responses to uncertainty. Sociologists are well-positioned to explain, offer insight, and provide input into public policy about such changes and the state of contemporary employment relations.},

The new type of integrated and holistic plans requires that members of the national parliament concentrate on strategic decision making and management by objectives, refraining from making decisions on single projects. Interviews with members of the national parliament's Standing Committee on Transport and Communications in 1997 and 2001 are used to study what the politicians mean by strategic transport planning and to present their expectations about its implementation and outcome. The problems experienced by elected representatives in rising above the project level and building transport policy on national strategic plans are the centre of attention. Increased efforts at the strategic planning level induce the national assembly to delegate project level decisions. The transaction cost politics approach sheds light on the question of whether or not members of parliament should delegate most project planning decisions about highways to the executive and what actions planners can take to make delegation more attractive.},

In this paper we set out a methodology for viewing those worlds using critical discourse analysis (CDA). This method focuses on four key textual features of plans: construal of substance, construction of agency, generic structure, and presentation. Together they enable the investigator to go beyond thematic discourses and uncover the institutional, political and ideological role of planning during the time period in which plans are produced. We use this method to interrogate the changing rationalities governing planning in Western Australia (WA) since the Second World War by analysing the four major city plans for Perth, covering a period from 1955 to 2010. This longitudinal analysis suggests that planning in WA mirrors concurrent trends in international planning theory, and highlights the significance of ``the plan'' as an object of inquiry for revealing the changing nature of planning and planners over time.},

  abstract = {Problem: Explicitly prohibited from regulating the land use planning activities of municipal and county governments by the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 131), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been forced to pursue an end-of-the-pipe approach to air quality management that has not proved successful in fully reducing ozone and fine particulate matter below health-based standards in many large U.S. cities. The persistence of these pollutants, in combination with a rapid rise in vehicle travel in recent decades, has raised concerns within the planning and public health communities about the long-term success of an air quality management program that is effectively divorced from the land use planning process. Purpose: This work, which is part of an EPA-sponsored study titled Projecting the Impact of Land Use and Transportation on Future Air Quality (PLUTO), was intended to assess the effectiveness of compact growth in improving air quality at a geographic scale compatible with secondary pollution formation and transport and over a planning horizon sufficient to capture the longer-term benefits of regional land use change. Methods: Future air quality is associated with alternative land development scenarios in this study through the integration of three separate and previously unrelated modeling components. These components consist of a set of standard population projection techniques, a household vehicle travel activity framework, and a mobile source emissions model (MOBILE 6) developed by the EPA. Results and conclusions: The results of our analysis find the median elasticity of vehicle travel with respect to density change over time to be -0.35, suggesting metropolitan areas can expect a 10\% increase in population density to be associated with a 3.5\% reduction in household vehicle travel and emissions. In addition, vehicle elasticities derived for urban and suburban census tracts across the 11 metro regions suggest density increments within urban zones (-0.43) to be more than twice as effective in reducing vehicle travel and emissions as density increments within suburban zones (-0.19). Takeaway for practice: We found compactness to be associated with greater reductions in vehicle travel than in previous studies, which suggests land use change can play a measurable role in improving regional air quality over time. Importantly, we found where compact growth occurs to be critically important to determining the extent to which higher density development reduces vehicle travel and emissions. We found the densification of urban zones to be more than twice as effective in reducing vehicle miles of travel and emissions as the densification of suburban zones, suggesting compact growth to be better for air quality than historical patterns of growth when densifying urban zones is given priority over non-urban zones.},

We offer two race-neutral

The first program, a federal job guarantee, would provide the economic security of a job and the removal of the threat of unemployment for all Americans. The second program, a substantial child development account that rises progressively based on the familial
asset positioning of the child's parents, would provide a pathways towards asset security

In this view, society consists of relatively equal and free individuals, operating in a fairly free market, while state intervention in people's lives and in the economy is only required in extreme cases such as market failure, as with urban and regional planning, and is conducted via top-to-bottom regulations. However, whether this outlook is suitable for sociopolitical cultures other than liberalism is questionable. This paper examines the modern planning machinery with respect to traditional, family-based societies, in particular the Arab towns and villages in Israel. It claims that, in addition to the national conflict between Arab citizens and the State of Israel, the embedded tensions between the spatiality of the Arab city and modern planning systems have given rise to the informal, gray urbanism currently typical of Arab towns. The paper analyzes the different planning tools resulting from the two worldviews. The use of a culturally based urban code and mutual agreements between interested parties form central planning instruments in familial societies, while administrative planning and regulation are central to modern traditions. Based on this analysis, the paper offers a framework for overcoming existing tensions.},

Reliance on motor vehicles, the competing interests of pedestrians and cyclists on shared pathways and problems associated with transit systems, public transport, and pedestrian infrastructure emerged as key barriers to older people venturing out of home on foot.

  abstract = {This paper uses Lipsky's classic formulation of ``street-level bureaucracy'' to explore the exercise of discretion by local policy practitioners in relation to a contaminated site in England. The policy literature generally assumes that practitioners seek to expand their discretion because this allows them to shape policy responses through the application of initiative and judgement. However, discretion is linked both to the degree of organisational and task complexity and to the level of uncertainty involved with making and implementing policy decisions. Such uncertainty affects practitioners' behaviour. They may develop rules to manage uncertainty, thereby tempering discretion. And where policy options offer little prospect for claiming credit and ample opportunity for being subject to blame, policy implementers often adopt a cautious approach to decisions or avoid taking them. The paper illustrates how practitioners use non-decision-making tactics\textemdash{}such as diversion of responsibility and bureaucratic inertia\textemdash{}to minimise the potential for blame. This offers an extended interpretation of the uses of discretion by street-level bureaucrats.},

It focuses on the meanings associated with this pattern of Black gentrification and the extent to which this residential pattern is consistent with previous models of urban gentrification. Using three years of ethnographic data from a low-income neighborhood in Philadelphia that has experienced an increase in Black middle-class residents, I conclude that this pattern of neighborhood change is distinct from previous models of urban gentrification. In this article, I argue that Black gentrification represents a unique set of opportunities and constraints that produce a group of middleclass African Americans willing to invest their social, economic, and cultural capital into improving the quality of life for low-income Black neighborhoods and their residents.},

This article focuses on the ways interpretations of justice have changed over a 10-year period in one selected municipality, Malm{\"o} in southern Sweden. Analyses of the comprehensive planning discourse in this municipality reveal that when it comes to substantive justice, discussions of structural inequality and segregation have gradually been replaced by discussions of social cohesion, while at the same time discussions of procedural justice and the need to create public spheres in which underprivileged groups are allowed a voice, have been replaced by discussions of open public spaces, allowing different groups to see each other. Though the issue of social justice seems to be downplayed in the urban planning discourse for the time being, counterforces within city administration are questioning the prevailing line of development.},

If this is so, we should witness an emergence of regional policies that combat concentrated poverty, segregation, and place-based inequalities that impose significant economic costs. This article assesses the extent and types of metropolitan equity efforts under new regionalism, the pathways through which they arise, and their prospects. Research finds that equity-based regional policies are increasing; they take diverse forms and are commonly shaped by state or federal programs, but they are not explicit and primary parts of regional agendas. While regional entities have not advanced explicit discussions about equity, a confluence of intergovernmental programs and quality of life issues has added regional equity to the portfolio of metropolitan goals.},

We investigate their motivations by analysing viability among urban small businesses; specifically, we compare the longevity of firms targeting clients in minority neighbourhoods to those serving clients in nonminority-white residential areas. Our broader concerns are to understand why the entrepreneurial occupational choice has been embraced. A key objective is to identify specific barriers that may retard small-firm creation and development in minority-neighbourhood environs. While some claim this market offers attractive opportunities, others stress that predominance of minority- and immigrant-owned firms in this sector reflects the fact that only the least desirable market niches are accessible to them. We find that serving local clienteles in minority neighbourhoods is strongly related to firm closure and low profitability.},

Drawing on an inventory of 255 wage theft laws proposed between 2004 and 2012, we evaluate three rival explanations of why wage theft legislation succeeds: worker grievances, political conditions, and movement strength. We find that states with larger numbers of worker centers and higher union density are more likely to both propose and enact wage theft legislation. Our results also suggest that urban reform movements maintain greater power to set legislative agendas than they do to ensure the passage of proposed laws. This suggest that ``new labor'' actors have developed state-level political power that warrants further scrutiny and explanation.},

This paper seeks to build on existing intellectual understanding to argue that future developments in planning thought must take questions of ethical value as their starting point. The paper is essentially divided into three parts. The first makes the important distinction between planning as a narrow set of regulatory practices and planning as an idea, or more particularly a long-enduring societal activity. It is the latter concept of planning that frames the discussion in the remainder of the paper. The second, in which the core of the argument is developed, explores the nature of planning as an activity; an activity that is centrally concerned with making ethical judgements about better and worse, with and for others, in just institutions. It is about an idea of value. The third section examines the implications of this perspective for planning as a subject of academic endeavour. The argument is illustrated throughout with examples drawn from the author's research.},

We found that while overall support for controlling growth remains high, support for government intervention in growth management has diminished. Overall, Florida's experience indicates that popular support for growth management is likely to persist in mature growth management states, even in the face of frustration with government implementation of such efforts and the emergence of political regimes that are less supportive of them.},

  abstract = {Can stronger state-level public policies help protect workers from ``wage theft?'' In recent years, workers' rights groups have responded to policy drift and legislative inaction at the national level by launching campaigns to enact stronger penalties for wage and hour violations at the state level. Many of these campaigns have been legislatively successful and formative for the development of ``alt-labor.'' But are such policies actually effective in deterring wage theft? Previous scholarship has long concluded that although stronger penalties should theoretically make a difference, in practice, they do not. But by confining the analysis to the admittedly weak national-level regulatory regime, the existing literature has eliminated all variation from the costs side of the equation and overlooked the rich variety of employment laws that exist at the state level. Using an original dataset of state laws, new estimates of minimum wage violations, and difference-in-differences analyses of a dozen recently enacted ``wage-theft laws,'' I find that stronger penalties can, in fact, serve as an effective deterrent against wage theft, but the structure of the policy matters a great deal, as does its enforcement. The implications for workers' rights and the changing shape of the labor movement are discussed in detail.},

Even today, Detroit's leadership calls for the demolition of one of the city's last remaining historic auto factories.

The motivations and rationale behind travel and provisioning choices of the working poor and the resources available to them are examined by means of a series of semistructured interviews conducted with members of twenty-six low-income house-holds residing in the Austin, Texas, area. The ways that these households cope with their mobility and economic disadvantage are complex, logical, and varied; depend on their resources and circumstances; and must be flexible to deal with day-to-day occurrences. Evidence from this study shows that the flexibility afforded by the automobile widens the spatial and temporal aspects of mobility, allowing for a more extensive search for goods and services. The automobile is an important mode for nonwork travel, even among those households that do not own one. However, the transit and walking remain critical in providing the mobility needed to access food-shopping destinations for these families.},

The results are plans and policies that aim both to facilitate automobile use and to encourage travel by other means, in all cases shielding travelers from paying, or even perceiving, the true cost of their travel. But off-the-shelf technologies now make it easy to price many transportation modes at close to marginal social cost, a change that would improve traffic flow, reduce emissions, and increase walking, biking, carpooling, and transit use in cities. While the political obstacles to better transportation pricing remain daunting, planners today have real opportunities to begin weaving transportation pricing into planning practice.},

The first nationwide data for places of 65,000 or more was released in the summer of 2006. It has several interesting implications for planning. On the one hand, more current data will eliminate many of the inaccuracies introduced by projection-based updates of stale census data. On the other, smaller sample sizes will mean we will have less precise estimates. Because the ACS will use averaged rather than point-in-time data, it will measure slightly different things than the decennial census. Finally, planners should be alert to the opportunities they will have to improve local data quality by improving the address file from which the sample is drawn.},

urban zones in six states, examining the factors that states use to choose zone locations and the subsequent
effect of the zones on business activity and employment. The source of outcome data is the U.S. Bureau of
Census' longitudinal research database (LRD), which tracks manufacturing establishments over
time. Matched sample and geographic comparison groups are created to measure the impact of zone policy on
employment, establishment, shipment, payroll, and capital spending outcomes. Consistent with previous findings,
the difference-in-difference estimates indicate that zones have little effect, on average.
However, by exploiting the establishment-level data to examine gross as well as net changes, the
analysis finds that zones have a positive effect on the outcomes of new establishments and a negative effect on
the outcomes of previously existing establishments. \textcopyright{} 2004 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis

  abstract = {The last decade has seen a proliferation of theoretical approaches, which have sought to uncover the changing form and governance of cities and regions following the dissolution of the Fordist `sociospatial fix'. This article provides a critical review of some of the more influential of these debates that have sought to analyse: the central\textendash{}local relations of government; the growing influence of `regimes' and `growth coalitions' in energizing urban economies; and the rise of the `learning' or `institutionally thick' region. The authors argue that, although providing valuable insights, these theories suffer from: 1) a failure to integrate analytically into their inquiries a relational account of the state, and thereby to neglect the state's influence in actively shaping the urban and regional fabric; and 2) a similar failure to problematize the issue of scale, often taking for granted the spatial context of their own particular inquiry. Thus, terms like urban regimes, urban coalitions and learning regions are deployed as if they were ontological and epistemological givens. Drawing on neo-Gramscian state theory and recent work on the `politics of scale', this article seeks to open up urban and regional research towards a multiscaled analysis, and to consider political economic activity as a series of situated, context-specific and politically constructed processes. These arguments are then briefly deployed to demonstrate the multifarious and multiscalar changes that characterize London's governance in the late 1990s.},

But beginning in the early 1960s, warnings were periodically issued that called into question the ability of the river to indefinitely supply the lion's share of the region's water. Seemingly ignoring these warnings, Atlanta's regional leaders pushed ahead, using the supposed threats to the region's water supply to support their efforts to shape the metropolis into a deeply manicured, low-density sprawl. Choosing this path eventually led to a courtroom showdown with neighboring states Alabama and Florida, in a case that could seriously curtail Atlanta's future withdrawals from the river and undermine the region's progrowth agenda. This article describes how and why this happened by telling the story of a complicated set of relationships that developed in 1970s between Atlanta's regional planning agency, the state of Georgia, and several federal agencies.},

It is ironic that the rules of citymaking\textemdash{}in particular, zoning\textemdash{}came to be associated with the near antithesis of diversity. Instead of promoting the mixing of people and uses, zoning produced just the opposite. While the history of zoning and its negative effects on urban diversity are widely known, the history of this association is more complex than is generally reported. This article sheds light on the connection between zoning and diversity from a new, historically informed perspective. The author contends that, although zoning was used for exclusionary purposes, the original thinking about zoning was often more nuanced with regard to diversity and mix than most critics of zoning allow. The author presents an historical review of what the original framers of zoning thought about the mixing of people and land uses in cities, and what their motivations were. The author concludes with an assessment of current zoning reform efforts in light of this history.},

Research reveals that in general, these designers, developers, and planners are endorsing New Urbanist ideas as a tool for achieving sustainable growth. The study shows that New Urbanist principles that focus on neighborhood design are most likely to be promoted and are expected to influence public policy, while principles that focus on regional planning may not generate enough support and are least likely to be implemented.

  abstract = {Increasing commute distances often lead to increased auto-dependency and is a major problem in many developed as well as developing countries. While in developed countries, the propensity to commute long distances generally originates from the preference to work in the core of the city and live in the suburb or periphery, in developing countries, the trend is often quite the opposite. For example, in Bangladesh, people generally have a strong preference to live at the heart of the major cities even if they work at the peripheral areas of the city, in another city or in a rural area. Further, it is also not uncommon to maintain split-families where the earning member of the family lives near the workplace while the rest of the family is based in a big city (subject to affordability). These phenomena lead to substantial increase in Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) and add burden to the transport infrastructure.
The focus of the research is to explore the key factors that induce middle and upper-middle class commuters in Bangladesh to live away from their workplace and/or maintain split-families. A case study is conducted using Stated Preference (SP) surveys conducted among the faculty members of two universities: one located at the periphery of the capital city and the other quite far away. Discrete Choice Models are developed using the collected data. Results reveal that albeit some differences, for both cases, the choices are strongly driven by quality of the education institutes and the house rent. Factors like gender, income and car-ownership, which traditionally play a strong role in the context of developed countries, are found to be of less significance.
The models, though estimated with limited data, provide useful insights about the factors that drive residential location choices in the context of a developing country and can help in formulating policies for encouraging people to live closer to their workplaces and thereby reduce commuter VMT.},

  abstract = {This article examines the ways in which issues of women's safety in public space are integrated into planning practice and policy. It deals with two processes of struggle for urban safety, addressing the integration of `voices from the field' into urban administration and planning, and questioning the possible adaptation of experiences of such integration, as developed in one socio-culture system, into another. The article focuses on a number of Canadian cities, and assesses if their experience is applicable to cities in Israel. Thus it considers the transferability of knowledge and the potential of cross-culture study, in relation to the production of professional knowledge. The first part of the article introduces the main issues to be explored in the article and considers these in the context of recent theoretical, professional and public debates, especially as related to gender and urban safety, and in relation to concepts of power, knowledge, meaning and identity. The second part presents the major findings of a research project related to local Canadian actions for urban safety and the urban policies adopted for its provision. The third part analyzes the applicability of the Canadian experience to the Israeli context and contains preliminary conclusions and recommendations as to the transferability of this experience.},

We take advantage of recent developments of panel cointegration techniques that control for endogeneity of regressors to estimate cointegration vectors. Empirical evidence shows that there exists a long-run equilibrium between productivity level and the three kinds of capital; among them, human capital turns out to have the strongest impact on productivity. Regional productivity is found also to be positively affected by R\&amp;D activity and public infrastructure of neighboring regions. Finally, results of the Granger-causality tests support the hypothesis that human capital and infrastructure Granger-cause productivity in the long-run while the opposite is not true; only for R\&amp;D stock is the bi-directional causality found.},

While urban designers, architects, and planners often encourage the use of aesthetic streetscape treatments to enhance the livability of urban streets, conventional transportation safety practice regards roadside features such as street trees as fixed-object hazards and strongly discourages their use. In this study, I examine the subject of livable streetscape treatments and find compelling evidence that suggests they may actually enhance the safety of urban roadways. Concerns about their safety effects do not appear to be founded on empirical observations of crash performance, but instead on a design philosophy that discounts the important relationship between driver behavior and safety. This study traces the origin and evolution of this philosophy, and proposes an alternative that may better account for the dynamic relationships between road design, driver behavior, and transportation safety.},

This research presents data gathered in ten neighborhoods in Campos. These neighborhoods were split into three distinct groups using wealth levels. Data obtained include the number of trees and private gardens and tree species diversity per neighborhood street. Our results demonstrate that the wealthier neighborhoods have both the highest tree biodiversity and number of trees. In contrast, the poorer neighborhoods present a low biodiversity level and fewer tree species. Our results also showed that age of the neighborhoods was not a factor in explaining the number of trees in public spaces. Socioeconomic and education levels of the population seem to play a more causal on tree quantity and species diversity. This inequality stresses a problem with environmental justice, a characteristic of Brazilian cities intrinsically connected to urban sustainability.},

Drawing on four case studies of European urban regions, the research finds that many of the dynamic processes underlying peri-urban development are not susceptible to the influence of planning agencies.

While progress has been made in enhancing large-scale models, some analysts have turned to post-processing and direct models to reduce modeling time and cost, and to better capture the travel impacts of neighborhood-scale land use strategies. This paper presents examples of direct or off-line modeling of rail and transit-oriented land use proposals for greater Charlotte, the San Francisco Bay Area exurbs, and south St. Louis County. These alternative approaches provided a useful platform for scenario testing, and their results revealed that concentrating development near rail stations produced an appreciable ridership bonus. These alternative models are appropriate as sketch-planning supplements to, not substitutes for, traditional four-step models.},

  abstract = {This article advances a critique of the `neighbourhood effects' genre in urban studies, by arguing that an acceptance of the `where you live affects your life chances' thesis, however well-intentioned, misses the key structural question of why people live where they do in cities. By examining the structural factors that give rise to differential life chances and the inequalities they produce, and by inverting the neighbourhood effects thesis to: your life chances affect where you live, the problem becomes one of understanding life chances via a theory of capital accumulation and class struggle in cities. Such a theory provides an understanding of the injustices inherent in letting the market (buttressed by the state) be the force that determines the cost of housing and therefore being the major determinant of where people live. The article draws on Marxist urban theory to contend that the residential mobility programs advocated by neighbourhood effects proponents stand on shaky ground, for if it is true that `neighbourhood effects' exceed what would be predicted by poverty alone, moving the poor to a richer place would only eliminate that incremental difference, without addressing the capitalist institutional arrangements that create poverty.},

The authors conclude by considering policy options for extending the reach of intermediation across the regional labor market through greater intercollege coordination.

  abstract = {The effect of urban form on residential energy use has attracted much research, but it may be difficult to grasp the conclusions of that research because of inconsistencies in scope and methods employed. This article reviews the literature on how urban form affects residential energy use, particularly energy for space-conditioning (heating and cooling). Climate-responsive design principles are examined first and linked to research on how several factors affect residential energy use: housing type, density (physical compactness and dwelling unit density), community layout (street orientation and building configuration), and planting and other surface coverage. The research on each of these factors is summarized under three categories: experiments, simulation modeling, and statistical analysis of empirical data. Finally, implications for future research are discussed and suggestions for planning are made.},

Increasingly, metropolitan airport passengers use multiple airports. Many airport employees ride public transportation to work. Together, these facts undermine the case for special-purpose, high-speed modes of airport access and argue for more cost-effective modes of public transport that distribute both passengers and employees effectively over metropolitan regions. While some extensions of municipal rail transit systems may be appropriate, planners should pay close attention to a range of rubber-tired, high-occupancy vehicles which can respond to the evolving needs of travelers and employees such as bus rapid transit.},

I conclude that some types of LGC\&M programs, principally residential caps, annexation controls, and voter-enacted super-majority approval requirements, do appear to significantly limit population growth in the cities that adopt them. I also find that LGC\&M programs that do not constrain housing production below their communities' shares of regional demand for housing are not principally responsible for high housing prices and rents. Finally, LGC\&M programs are associated with an increased likelihood of infill development in the cities that adopt them, and with growth displacement to nearby communities.},

  abstract = {Immigrants often bunch together in particular lines of work, which many scholars call employment niching. They also may cluster geographically; these districts can be neighbourhoods where workers reside or places of work (industrial quarters where labour is performed). The intrametropolitan spatial division of labour is perhaps best conceived as the relationships among employment concentrations in industrial niches and places of work shaped in large measure by the geographies of residence. The analysis of six immigrant groups reported in this paper models the effect of residential concentration on the chances that an immigrant holds a job in a particular line of work, labours in a particular work place, or does both\textemdash{}works in a particular job and work place. The study, which uses Greater Los Angeles' census tracts for the analysis, reveals that residential patterns help to govern the extent of this industrial segmentation and employment geography but that this relationship is not consistent across immigrant groups. The investigation adds to the literature on labour market segmentation by ethnicity, gender, nativity and home\textendash{}work relations and offers new perspectives on the relationship between spaces of production and social reproduction in metropolitan places.},

Scholars agree that ``reflexivity'' has a strong temporal dimension: it not only aims to solve present planning problems, but to imagine and understand alternative trajectories for future action. This article explores the practical utility of reflexivity for planners, through a case study that focuses on a project to promote sustainable development in the Port of Amsterdam. Reflexivity in planning emerges as a new tool for generating critical knowledge and dialogue that can synthesise the perspectives of multiple actors in a common understanding, existing structural constraints and a collective imagination of alternative future possibilities. Such research highlights the potential of this approach to generate a creative reconfiguration of the present, and to build capacity for meaningful and considered change.},

  abstract = {Problem: Land trusts are important influences on land conservation and providers of protected open space in the United States, having fostered the conservation of millions acres of land. These conserved lands provide public benefits ranging from clean water to scenic views. What policy changes might help land trusts provide the equally important, but more challenging, public benefits of broad and inclusive public access? Purpose: I explore how equitable land trusts provide access to their properties and recommend what planners and others can do to encourage public access to properties protected by land trusts. Methods: I conducted a national survey of land trusts in the United States, gathering data on their characteristics and their approaches to public access. I use descriptive statistics to document and explain the extent to which they allow public access to the properties they own and manage. Results and conclusions: The majority of land trusts (78\%) provide public access to some or all of their properties. However, public access is not the top priority for most land trusts. Most acreage under conservation easement does not allow public access, and even on lands owned by trusts, only modest action has been taken to promote public access. In addition, only a small share of land trusts work in urban areas or focus on acquiring land near population centers, where demand for public access is likely to be greatest. These findings provide a starting point for a broader discussion of how to provide equitable public access to conserved land. Takeaway for practice: Land trusts should continue to conserve land for ecological protection, but should also emphasize land conservation in urban areas and for public access and recreation, which were goals of public programs in the 1960s and 1970s. A renewed emphasis on public access could help build public support for land trusts' work and broaden their constituencies, which many of their representatives have expressed desires to do.

A model of sustainable city-university relationship is proposed and matched with evidence from nine case studies of European cities hosting a large higher education sector; the role of policy and planning to sustain and enhance such links is also brought to the fore through the illustration of various best practices in the case studies.},

The article demonstrates that understanding and solving street homelessness must involve looking beyond the provision of housing alone. If effective policies are to be formulated, planners need to understand the nature of homelessness and the events that have shaped homelessness. A holistic and proactive approach based on phenomenological participation and co-operative exploration could improve understanding and help provide a more comprehensive solution. This would further assist, not only street homeless women, but also other women in crisis or survival situations.},

It traces their origins to the societal crises such as culture conflict, war, and depression that have shaken American society in the course of the last century, or to periods of recovery from such crises. It shows how they have succeeded each other in time, so as to constitute more or less distinct eras of planning thought and practice. It also notes how the same ideologies confront each other in space resulting in severe land-use conflicts, especially at the edges of metropolitan areas. In the light of these ideologies, the article raises questions about the nature and future of the contemporary American planning profession.},

In response, policy makers have designed policies that reduce risks to assist developers in overcoming bounds on their rationality. However, after decades of such policies, there is little evidence that developers have stopped satisficing. This article argues that bounded rationality is an insufficient explanation for satisficing by small developers. Lessons from behavioral economics suggest additional reasons for satisficing by developers. Satisficing is common because developers bracket projects one at a time, bracket each investment decision in isolation of others, create nonfungible investment accounts, establish self-imposed liquidity constraints, and temporally space projects. Policies that group risks to developers are likely to be the most effective. However, additional land-market-specific research is required to design policies that address these psychological traits. Academicians also need to design better survey instruments to investigate developer decision making.},

The sample used is the largest of its kind, covering 210 projects in 14 nations worth U.S. \$59 billion. The study shows with very high statistical significance that forecasters generally do a poor job of estimating the demand for transportation infrastructure projects. For 9 out of 10 rail projects, passenger forecasts are overestimated; the average overestimation is 106\%. For half of all road projects, the difference between actual and forecasted traffic is more than $\pm$20\%. The result is substantial financial risks, which are typically ignored or downplayed by planners and decision makers to the detriment of social and economic welfare. Our data also show that forecasts have not become more accurate over the 30-year period studied, despite claims to the contrary by forecasters. The causes of inaccuracy in forecasts are different for rail and road projects, with political causes playing a larger role for rail than for road. The cure is transparency, accountability, and new forecasting methods. The challenge is to change the governance structures for forecasting and project development.

An international review of planning curricula indicated a widespread consensus with respect to key competencies required of planners. This understanding was used in the development of new teaching programs at three Sri Lankan universities. Complementing the technical core knowledge areas, strong emphases on problem structuring, critical and strategic thinking, and the understanding of the political and institutional contexts appear to be crucial to making the agenda of ``planning for sustainable development'' more than a fashionable clich{\'e}. In order for these core areas to have relevance in a developing country context, however, planning curricula need to achieve a balance between local priorities and a ``global'' perspective.},

The Slum Networking Project (SNP) in Ahmedabad, India, is an internationally recognized ``best practice'' in participatory slum upgrading. We illustrate how changing the nature of multi-stakeholder participation in the SNP affected its potentials for sustainability and scaling up. Stakeholder ability to alter the institutional arrangement resulted in a significant transfer of project implementation responsibility and authority from the state to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Although these stakeholder-initiated institutional innovations initially expedited and expanded SNP and made it more sustainable, we argue that the enlarged role for NGOs in the current institutional arrangement can limit the program's potential for further scaling up.},

It begins by describing the nature of employment change in one archetypical gentrifying neighborhood\textemdash{}Chicago's Wicker Park\textemdash{}to motivate the central hypothesis that gentrification is associated with industrial restructuring. Next, a detailed analysis is presented on the long-term employment changes in neighborhoods that have experienced gentrification during the 1990s across a sample of 20 large central cities. This analysis shows that employment grew slightly faster in gentrifying neighborhoods than other portions of the central city. However, jobs in restaurants and retail services tended to replace those lost in goods-producing industries. This process of industrial restructuring occurred at a faster rate in gentrifying areas. Thus gentrification can be considered a contributory and catalytic factor in accelerating the shift away from manufacturing with urban labor markets.},

However, this article shows that in the case of a new rapid-rail development in Vancouver, Canada, the private-public-partnership method of project delivery has been largely incongruent with increased accountability while failing to drive technological innovation or limit cost escalations during the planning process.},

It is not surprising, therefore, that he applied geometry in community and city planning projects to define and enhance determinants such as land use, spatial configuration, transportation routes, and building mass and to anticipate social interactions. Four projects of the period between 1909 and 1935 are analyzed.},

We look at the way in which growth controls\textemdash{}given fragmentation\textemdash{}produce ``spillovers'' and whether spillovers have been a principal force (process) fueling suburbanization and exurbanization in recent decades. Although the role of spillovers has received some attention recently, few scholars have launched comprehensive analyses of its impact on the contemporary urban landscape. Our spillovers-based explanation of sprawl will likely hold for metropolitan regions in which growth management/control has been imposed in the absence of statewide or regionwide coordination.},

Most transportation infrastructure investment decisions, for example, provide disproportionate benefits to suburban commuters as compared to those for low-income inner city dwellers. Construction of convention centers, sports arenas, and high rise office towers also provides few long-term tangible benefits to low-income residents. Tax breaks, land write-downs and other incentives targeted toward large employers and developers seldom create new jobs for low-income people. In short, without an understanding of the differential impacts of public policy on various class and ethnic groups, what is planned in the name of ``the public'' seldom provides significant benefits to minorities, particularly those with limited incomes.},

The common interpretation is that zoning was first used in these countries and then imported to America. But this interpretation neglects the extent to which American zoning began to deviate from European traditions early on. Based on primary and secondary archival sources, this paper tells a story about two aspects of zoning that set U.S. practice apart from that in Europe. The first is the purely residential district and the second is the purely single-family residential district. The European\textendash{}American comparison helps highlight the distinct nature of U.S. land-use regulation.},

  abstract = {Planners throughout the 20th century have advocated containment of urban sprawl through a variety of means. Urban containment is incorporated into the growth management programs of several states, and growth management policies exist in at least 95 metropolitan areas. One objective of containment is to concentrate development within areas that are already urbanized, particularly in central cities. In this article, we examine the effects of the first round of urban containment programs (adopted prior to 1985) on the amount of development activity taking place in central cities and on the ratio of central-city to metropolitan-area development activity. Our findings indicate that central cities in contained metropolitan areas are attracting more development activity than central cities in uncontained areas. However, suburban areas in both contained and uncontained metropolitan areas continue to grow. We surmise that containment shifts development from exurban and rural areas to suburban and urban ones because of containment boundaries.},

The debate has been marked by many different claims about the nature of cities, including declarations that the urban is an incoherent concept, that urban society is nothing less than modern society as a whole, that the urban scale can no longer be separated from the global scale, and that urban theory hitherto has been deeply vitiated by its almost exclusive concentration on the cities of the global North. This article offers some points of clarification of claims like these. All cities can be understood in terms of a theoretical framework that combines two main processes, namely, the dynamics of agglomeration/polarization, and the unfolding of an associated nexus of locations, land uses and human interactions. This same framework can be used to identify many different varieties of cities, and to distinguish intrinsically urban phenomena from the rest of social reality. The discussion thus identifies the common dimensions of all cities without, on the one hand, exaggerating the scope of urban theory, or on the other hand, asserting that every individual city is an irreducible special case.},

Yet these policies have not protected Portland from broader trends that have increased urban poverty over the past several decades in the U.S., including social welfare cuts and the shift in the economy to the service sector. In terms of poverty dynamics and social policies, we argue that while regional planning and other progressive policies have helped protect Portland from extremely high concentrated poverty present in many large U.S. cities, it has still experienced growing social dislocations associated with national and macro-level social and economic factors. These trends suggest both the possibilities and limits of local policy, regional planning, and activism for ameliorating the deleterious consequences of social welfare retrenchment and franchise capitalism for vulnerable urban populations, and highlight the importance of the broader social policy context and economic change for understanding urban poverty and the experiences of the urban poor.},

The first was associated with neighbourhood characteristics (accessibility, green areas, commercial services and cultural services) and the second with dwelling characteristics (flat size, gym and pool in the building, and cleanness and state of the front street). Price/mortgage was kept as the only attribute present in both games. With the data bank obtained, flexible discrete choice models were estimated in order to derive willingness-to-pay (WTP) for these various attributes. Higher WTP for urban attributes (i.e. accessibility, and cleanliness of the neighbourhood) and lower valuation for attributes related to recreation (i.e. gym and pool, cultural services) were found. The implications of these findings in the design of public policy related to re-populating the Santiago city centre are then discussed. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Drawing on a series of case studies from across the country, we argue that all these variants have a role but that social movement regionalism may be particularly effective in productively addressing the inevitable tensions and conflicts that emerge in regional equity strategies, including the relationship to business-oriented regionalism, labor\textendash{}community alliances, and the role of race. We conclude by speculating on the recent efforts of social movement regionalism to scale up, suggesting that this could present an important contribution to a broader and deeper movement for progressive social change in the United States.},

The mandate is likely to force markets to oversupply parking and undersupply housing.

  abstract = {State-led growth management has been criticized as inflexible in addressing the range of situations that communities face. A second issue is that while many of the goals of smart growth can be achieved through regulation, others require funding for implementation. In 2000, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts passed legislation called the Community Preservation Act (CPA), an experiment in enabling communities to tax themselves to implement growth management/smart growth actions at the local level. This article examines that act as to whether it demonstrates flexibility in its application across communities in the state, analyzed according to sub/urban to rural character. The act is found to appeal to a wide range of communities for overlapping but also divergent reasons and provides a flexible method to aid communities in implementing a limited set of smart growth goals.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the decentralization of employment using zip code data on employment by industry. Most American cities are decentralized on average less than 16 percent of employment in metropolitan areas is within a three mile radius of the city center. In decentralized cities, the classic stylized facts of urban economics (i.e. prices fall with distance to the city center, commute times rise with distance and poverty falls with distance) no longer hold. Decentralization is most common in manufacturing and least common in services. The human capital level of an industry predicts its centralization, but the dominant factor explaining decentralization is the residential preferences of workers. Political borders also impact employment density which suggests that local government policies significantly influence the location of industry.},

In the late 1970s, the blurring of lines between public and private action spurred significant intellectual debate in the U.S. literature, and concern that those financing and carrying out public/ private projects had too much influence compared to those who would ultimately pay for or be affected by the projects. As a consequence, the early literature on public/private development projects in the United States did little to enlighten. This has been changing, however, and academic literature from abroad has used inventive means to analyze public/private developments and generalize about their impacts and significance. I synthesize the case-based research on public/private development projects to extract insights and lessons for planning, deal making, and performance, concluding by recommending the additional research that I consider most needed.},

  abstract = {Much current activism and scholarship has raised concern that the various processes of neoliberal restructuring are threatening democracy. More specifically, researchers in geography and other social sciences have stressed that political and economic restructuring in cities is negatively affecting the enfranchisement of urban residents. Much recent research and writing has explored progressive responses to this perceived disenfranchisement in cities. One popular trend has been a fascination with the idea of the `right to the city' as a way to respond to neoliberal urbanism and better empower urban dwellers. I argue that the right to the city holds promise, but that in the literature the idea remains both theoretically and politically underdeveloped. It remains unclear (1) what the right to the city entails or (2) how it might address current problems of disenfranchisement. This paper examines the right to the city in greater depth. It does so by offering a close reading and analysis of the intellectual roots of the idea: the writings of Henri Lefebvre. I suggest that Lefebvre's right to the city is more radical, more problematic, and more indeterminate than the current literature makes it seem. The paper concludes by suggesting that the right to the city does offer distinct potential for resisting current threats to urban enfranchisement. However, the right to the city is not a panacea. It must be seen not as a completed solution to current problems, but as an opening to a new urban politics, what I call an urban politics of the inhabitant.},

Plans are evaluated for attention to six commonly accepted smart growth principles as developed and promoted by a number of national organizations and coalitions. This content analysis reveals that communities are not fully embracing the smart growth agenda. Furthermore, there is a clear distinction between the use of smart growth principles among cities and villages versus town or rural governments.

This article argues that questions of value are an inescapable part of the activity of planning and hence its purpose is to identify the key dimensions of a reconceptualized notion of justice for planning. The argument is presented through consideration of two key themes: the relationship between the individual and the collective, and the notion of ``reasonableness'' in relation to matters of public policy related to planning. The implications of this analysis lead on to consideration of the scope of collective obligations and the nature of judgment and reasoning in planning. The article concludes by arguing that justice in planning is about situated ethical judgment\textemdash{} a conceptualization of justice that raises significant issues in relation to future developments in planning thought.},

Models of an ideal community are created by ninety-three rural children and fifty urban children in a design charrette. Model content is analyzed using multivariate statistics to identify element and pattern preferences. Principal component analysis of the resultant thirty-eight models reveals that for the rural children, six components are considered significant dimensions and explain 67 percent of the variance, with the first component accounting for nearly 27 percent of the variance. For the urban children, four components are significant and explain 51 percent of the variance, with the first component accounting for nearly 15 percent of the variance. Spatial diagrams indicate that there is a difference between the rural and urban models. Furthermore, discriminant analysis reveals that there is a statistical difference between the content of the urban and rural models at a significance level of .007.},

This paper analyses the relationship between industrial total factor productivity and public capital across the 20 Italian administrative regions. It adds upon the existing literature in a number of ways: it analyses a longer period (1970\textendash{}98); it allows for the role of human capital accumulation; it tests for the existence of a long-run relationship between total factor productivity and public capital (through previously suggested panel techniques) and for weak exogeneity of public capital; and it assesses the significance of public capital within a non-parametric set-up based on the Free Disposal Hull. The results confirm that public capital has a significant impact on the evolution of total factor productivity, particularly in the Southern regions. This impact is mainly ascribed to the core infrastructures (road and airports, harbours, railroads, water and electricity, telecommunications). Also, core infrastructures are weakly exogenous.},

  abstract = {Recent ILO research found that a cluster of OECD countries that might be called `numerically flexible' does in fact demonstrate good labour market results: employment rates overall and rates for relevant groups (young/female/older) are higher and unemployment is lower than in countries with less numerical flexibility as measured by employment tenure. However, when considering indicators of job quality the picture is mixed, with some countries exhibiting low shares of good quality employment and some others high shares. The discriminating variable seems to be labour market institutions and policies. A conclusion is that if efficiency and equity are sought in labour markets in open economies then institutions and policies for `protected mobility' should exist. Institution building (or transformation of existing institutions) is important on several accounts. Firstly, globalization and technical change transforms employment relations and entail more volatility and less security. Secondly, collective bargaining agendas have to be extended to include labour market policies, as employers' demands for more adjustment flexibility will increasingly be accompanied by worker representatives' demands for better security in change. In other words: reduced employment protection has to be compensated by labour market security if decent work is a target. Protected mobility by sound labour market policies might result in real `flexicurity' (adaptability for firms and security for workers) and become a common objective of both sides of industry while also reconfirming an enhanced role for the State.},

  abstract = {Racial earnings inequalities in the United States diminished significantly over the three decades following World War II, but since then have not changed very much. Meanwhile, black\textemdash{}white disparities in employment have become increasingly pronounced. What accounts for this historical pattern? Sociologists often understand the evolution of racial wage and employment inequality as the consequence of economic restructuring, resulting in narratives about black economic fortunes that emphasize changing skill demands related to the rise and fall of the industrial economy. Reviewing a large body of work by economic historians and other researchers, this article contends that the historical evidence is not consistent with manufacturing- and skills-centered explanations of changes in relative black earnings and employment. Instead, data from the 1940s onward suggest that racial earnings inequalities have been significantly influenced by political and institutional factors\textemdash{}social movements, government policies, unionization efforts, and public-employment patterns\textemdash{}and that racial employment disparities have increased over the course of the postwar and post-1970s periods for reasons that are not reducible to skills. Taking a broader historical view suggests that black economic fortunes have long been powerfully shaped by nonmarket factors and recenters research on racial discrimination as well as the political and institutional forces that influence labor markets.},

The analysis combines two unique data sets (the National Establishment Time Series and historic zoning maps) and uses multivariate analysis to examine the role of zoning in firm expansion, controlling for firm characteristics, industry, building characteristics, and location. Firm size plays the most important role, but the availability of industrially-zoned land and large buildings also helps firms to expand. The article concludes by outlining land use and economic development strategies that help cities target firms creating jobs on industrial land.},

Analysis of census data in thirteen Canadian metropolitan areas shows that households where one or both maintainers work from home have a greater propensity to reside in larger single-family detached houses than comparable households with maintainers who commute to work. The home-work variable increases the probability of single-family dwelling occupancy more than age, immigration, and household size, demographic variables generally highly associated with single-family dwelling occupancy. Although issues of causality cannot be empirically resolved here, if home work requires more space, it is one of the factors that would influence the tendency to continue to reside in the larger single-family dwellings. These dwellings have greater environmental impacts than more compact housing types that planners promote as part of their sustainability goals.},

  abstract = {Planning theory shares with critical urban theory an orientation toward normative political questions and a `politics of the possible'. Beyond those broad contours, however, it is fair to say that only a thin slice of planning theory takes up the normative commitments of critical urban theory: to challenge the violence of capitalism, to seek out the agents of revolutionary social change and to interrogate the ends in relation to the means of practice. In this paper I aim to develop such normative orientations in planning theory by drawing on theoretical resources in the cognate field of critical development studies. The professional practices which both critical development studies and planning theory take as their object of study share a duplicitous relationship to processes of capitalist accumulation and liberal notions of benevolent trusteeship. Yet, critical development studies has clearly done a better job of tracing the entanglements of projects of improvement with projects of empire. When such theorizations about development are brought to bear on the more subtle object of urban planning, here too the flagrancies of liberal benevolence can be exposed and challenged. The paper is organized into three sections that take up key domains in which I believe planning theory can draw (or has drawn) productively from critical development studies to strengthen its capacity to envision and defend the right to the city. These are (a) the relationship of planning to imperialism and globalization, (b) resistance and the cultural politics of agency, and (c) the contributions of transnational feminism to a praxis of solidarity and collaboration.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT We estimate a model of urban productivity in which the agglomeration effect of density is enhanced by a metropolitan area's stock of human capital. Estimation accounts for potential biases due to the endogeneity of density and industrial composition effects. Using new information on output per worker for U.S. metropolitan areas along with a measure of density that accounts for the spatial distribution of population, we find that a doubling of density increases productivity by 2\textendash{}4 percent. Consistent with theories of learning and knowledge spillovers in cities, we demonstrate that the elasticity of average labor productivity with respect to density increases with human capital. Metropolitan areas with a human capital stock one standard deviation below the mean realize no productivity gain, while doubling density in metropolitan areas with a human capital stock one standard deviation above the mean yields productivity benefits that are about twice the average. These patterns are particularly pronounced in industries where the exchange of information and sharing of ideas are important parts of the production process.},

It looks at the effect that conflict over meaning-making in representations of cultural heritage can have on an inhabited historic environment. Narratives of particular interventions and historically developed discourses are analysed to explore how they become socially appropriated. An analytical framework is developed to unfold the narrative and heritage dimensions of interventions in the historic city of Nablus. Focusing on the periods of ``peace'' and ``Second Intifada'', the conclusions show how actual conservations in occupied societies are not only influenced by direct violence, but are also enmeshed with discursive control over heritage questions relating to identity and superiority.},

The paper critically examines three contemporary schools of thought that consider in different ways the relationship between cities, social cohesion and the environment. It begins with a critical examination of the notion of urban sustainability. The paper will then move on to consider two approaches that emphasise issues of (in)equality and (in)justice in the urban environment, those of environmental justice and urban political ecology. The final part of the paper pinpoints four areas of research that urban researchers must examine if we are to understand more fully\textemdash{}and act more politically on\textemdash{}the nexus between cities, social cohesion and the environment.},

The Brundtland Report's definition of sustainable development calls for all dimensions of sustainability to be considered. Given that today's planning processes deal with large volumes of basic data where epistemological and technical knowledge must be co-ordinated with the actors' values and views of society, this makes spatial planning a very complex process for local planning authorities. The question is whether these ideals of sustainability are manageable in a complex planning situation. Case histories of the implementation process in Sweden indicate that local authorities seek to limit this complexity by dividing the main topics, i.e. ecological, social and economic, into separate planning processes and planning documents. Furthermore, each of the sustainability dimensions seems to be strengthened by social discourses, which can be recognised in the visions of the local plans. The various modes of planning correspond to and are strengthened by these discourses.},

Green space also promotes physical activity, psychological well-being, and the general public health of urban residents. This paper reviews the Anglo-American literature on urban green space, especially parks, and compares efforts to green US and Chinese cities. Most studies reveal that the distribution of such space often disproportionately benefits predominantly White and more affluent communities. Access to green space is therefore increasingly recognized as an environmental justice issue. Many US cities have implemented strategies to increase the supply of urban green space, especially in park-poor neighborhoods. Strategies include greening of remnant urban land and reuse of obsolete or underutilized transportation infrastructure. Similar strategies are being employed in Chinese cities where there is more state control of land supply but similar market incentives for urban greening. In both contexts, however, urban green space strategies may be paradoxical: while the creation of new green space to address environmental justice problems can make neighborhoods healthier and more esthetically attractive, it also can increase housing costs and property values. Ultimately, this can lead to gentrification and a displacement of the very residents the green space strategies were designed to benefit. Urban planners, designers, and ecologists, therefore, need to focus on urban green space strategies that are `just green enough' and that explicitly protect social as well as ecological sustainability.},

We confirm earlier results concerning the value of proximity, and also find that markets exhibit value increases at different stages during the planning and construction process.},

  abstract = {This article explores the relationships between changes in the conception of urban peripheries and changes in urban renewal policies, mainly focusing on policy debates and theoretical discourses developed within Italy. The aim is to test the usefulness of a non-conventional approach to urban peripheries, both from a theoretical and practical point of view. According to this approach, urban peripheries can be thought of as plural and complex places, which are considered to be a fundamental part of the city and as the builders of urban identity. The article initially explores the changes in describing and interpreting urban peripheries, showing how they must be related to actual changes in urban settlement dynamics, as well as to changes in the theoretical frameworks used to understand the phenomenon of the Italian `urban periphery'. The article then shows how changes in interpretation have redefined the objectives and methods of policy interventions in the Italian context. Finally, certain critical issues will be discussed, in particular the origins of urban renewal policies and their recent evolution; the redefinition of the local authority role, and the relationships between institutional and social projects and activities. In this view, institutional projects are considered to be the formal projects carried out by public actors, for example municipalities, in order to manage the change in urban peripheries while social projects are understood as the informal practices of inhabitants of peripheries that change their living neighbourhoods.},

This led to resettlement farther from their former homes and negatively affected employment. Women were especially vulnerable following eviction, with their post-eviction pay falling because of the nature and location of their pre-eviction work.},

The author suggests that there are problems in Wilson's research methodology that may too quickly lead to his notion that inner-city joblessness is far more apt to be the result of ``unflattering behaviors'' of poor Blacks rather than the persistently discriminatory assumptions and hiring practices of employers. Wilson's findings are compared with those from the author's own employer interview study. Only 4 of the 44 employers interviewed felt that Black workers had poorer work ethics and attitudes than Whites. Reasons are presented for the differences, and the article concludes with a brief discussion of the policy implications of these findings.},

  abstract = {Problem: Groundwater contamination is a concern in rural residential subdivisions where numerous septic systems and private wells are sited in close proximity. Although most state codes regulate the construction and location of private wells, these regulations do not usually account for site-specific conditions that may impact drinking-water quality. Purpose: Groundwater models provide a technical basis for delineating groundwater flow to domestic wells. Despite their widespread use in the hydrologic sciences, planners and developers rarely have access to such models. We aimed to assess existing regulations for domestic wells and septic systems and illustrate how groundwater models can be used to evaluate strategies for additional drinking-water protection in unsewered residential subdivisions. Methods: We developed groundwater flow models for two subdivisions in southern Wisconsin, analyzed the results, and disseminated them to local officials, developers, and residents. Results and conclusions: Models of both subdivisions indicate that deeper individual wells or a single community well within a protected source area would improve the likelihood of obtaining high-quality drinking water. In response, several homeowners in one subdivision chose to pay for deeper wells and well casings or individual home water-treatment systems. The developer of the second site incorporated an unenforceable recommendation for deeper well casings into subdivision covenants, but none of the wells drilled so far have followed the recommendation. Implementing and enforcing well construction or setback criteria based on model results may require changing Wisconsin state codes to explicitly define what can and cannot be regulated at the local level. Takeaway for practice: Hydrogeologists can use standard groundwater modeling methods and information about local hydrologic conditions to inform planners as they develop guidelines to improve drinking-water quality. Partnerships between local hydrogeologists and planners are essential because differences in hydrogeologic setting, groundwater quality concerns, and regulatory structure will cause model results and proposed guidelines to vary on a case-by-case basis. Research support: Funding for this research was provided by the EPA Science to Achieve Results (STAR) graduate fellowship program, the University of Wisconsin Groundwater Resources Advisory Council (administered by the Wisconsin Water Resources Institute), and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.},

It begins from the premise that a primary root of modern American race relations can be found in the southern past, especially in how that past was imagined, articulated, and performed during a crucial period: the post-Reconstruction era known as ``Jim Crow.'' More than just a reaction to a turbulent world where Civil War defeat destabilized categories of power and authority, white cultural memory there became an active ingredient in defining life in the New South. The culture of segregation that mobilized such memories, and the forgetting that inevitably accompanied them, relied on performance, ritualized choreographies of race and place, and gender and class, in which participants knew their roles and acted them out for each other and for visitors. Among the displays of white southern memory most active during Jim Crow, the Natchez Pilgrimage stands out. Elite white women served as the principal actors in making an imaginative geography that became a bedrock of cultural hegemony based on white supremacy. In order to reconstruct the performances of whiteness in Natchez, Mississippi, and to disentangle the constitutive relationship between race and place, this article makes use of qualitative methods that rely on previously unused archival materials and on ethnographic fieldnotes.},

By spreading waves of Modernism, an evident contrast emerged between the historic core and the new areas; therefore, the inner city became an isolated-inactive part that was unable to adapt itself with the new urban life. Pursuing an analytic-suggestive method, this article aims to explore how a courtyard-based tissue can be synchronized with the new lifestyle. Considering the theoretical bases in regard to conservation\textendash{}modernization of historic contexts, this article investigates the spatial transformation of the introverted frozen frameworks. It discusses how instead of the present restrictive conservation policies the introverted Islamic neighborhoods could be modernized. In this regard, the present rules and codes related to the historic areas are critically verified. Moreover, by analyzing the physical remodeling realized in the recent interventions, the article represents controversial proposals to connect the isolated private courtyards to the streets network. The article concludes that regulations and policies should be devised to ensure conserving the courtyard-based pattern as well as redevelopment of introverted neighborhoods. By formulating policies and appropriating the codes in regard to relationship between closed and open spaces and also utilization of new technologies, both the conservation and innovation objectives could be achieved in the framework of a balanced view.},

Yet, casting justice in terms of equality of opportunity alone means neglecting the non-economic aspects of life \textendash{} capabilities, social needs, urban life and vitality. Changing the spatial distribution of the population may create a more optimal and equitable spatial allocation, but in some ways it fails to acknowledge basic human aspirations to live in security, in community, or in a revitalized core.

This shows that ``slow planning'' can be an asset for preserving green areas. Moreover, the Midden-Delfland case exhibits a promising combination of collaborative planning and top-down project planning, indicating that different ways of influencing spatial developments, such as supporting spatial quality by carrying out contract works and maintenance, changing zones, and modifying land ownership, can be beneficial in practice.},

  abstract = {Urban planners and urban planning as a field face a major challenge in balancing urban development interests against the need to safeguard socially equitable and ecologically functional green space. This need is still commonly seen through a modernist lens, whereby large-scale green areas are viewed as an antithesis to the city, creating a polarised landscape seemingly free from cross-scale social and ecological interactions. This study reports on a transdisciplinary work process that aimed to challenge this polarisation by exploring more integrative and operative planning approaches to large-scale urban green structures, using the concept of resilience, both as a theoretical umbrella and in relation to a case study in Stockholm, Sweden. The exploration took the form of a series of workshops in which professionals from the fields of planning, urban design, ecology, landscape architecture, and environmental history, as well as city-wide and regional planning, took part. Throughout the process, tentative designs served as ``touchstones'', bringing questions from a theoretical level to a hands-on, specific, local context. This paper identifies three ways that resilience science can be useful in the planning and management of large urban green structures. Firstly, resilience can introduce complexity and thus make visible synergies and ``win\textendash{}win'' situations within planning. Secondly, in highlighting change, resilience can offer alternatives to present conservationist perspectives on green space planning and thus offer constructive ways out of planning-related deadlocks. Thirdly, resilience can be advantageously combined with the concept of ``legibility'' in clarifying common goals and thus helping to build a constituency which will sustain large-scale green structures over time.},

The concept of `sense of place', and the need to protect and enhance `special places', has underpinned UK conservation legislation and policy in the post-war era. In Northern Ireland, due to its distinctive settlement tradition, its troubled political circumstances and its centralised administrative system, a unique hierarchy of `special places' has evolved, involving `areas of townscape and village character' as well as conventional `conservation areas'. For the first time a comprehensive comparative survey of the townscape quality of most of these areas has been carried out in order to test the hypothesis that too many conservation area designations may `devalue the conservation coinage'. It also assesses the contribution that `areas of townscape character' can make in this situation, as potential conservation areas or as second-level local amenity designations. Its findings support the initial hypothesis: assessment of townscape quality on the basis of consistent criteria demonstrates a decline in the quality of more recent conservation area designations, and hence some `devaluation of the coinage'. However, the need for local discretion in the protection of local amenity supports the concept of `areas of townscape and village character' as an additional and distinct designation. This contradicts recent policy recommendations from the Northern Ireland Planning Commission and contains valuable lessons for conservation policy and practice in other parts of the UK.},

The concept and theorization that undergirds its meaning and function do not address the root causes that are central to complex dynamics between public education and prisons. This paper argues that in place of the articulation of the school to prison pipeline, what is needed is a nuanced and historicized understanding of the racialized politics pertaining to the centrality of education to Black liberation struggles. The result of such work indicates that the enclosure of public education foregrounds the expansion of the prison system and consequently, schools are not a training ground for prisons, but are the key site at which technologies of control that govern Black oppression are deemed normal and necessary.},

A new wave of scholarship examines the relationship of gentrification and displacement to public investment in transit infrastructure. Scholarship has generally conflated gentrification and displacement; however, this review argues for a clearer analytical distinction between the two. Although the displacement discussion in the United States began with the role of the public sector and now has returned to the same focus, it will be necessary to overcome methodological shortcomings to arrive at more definitive conclusions about the relationship.},

In the controversies surrounding the Government's plans to further the filling in of the beautiful Victoria Harbour to produce land for ``development'' in the first decade of the post-colonial Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), participatory and multi-stakeholder-centred planning practices emerged when many interested parties were dissatisfied with the official reclamation plan. Using the Protection of the Harbour Ordinance, an anti-reclamation civil society organization managed to take the government to court and successfully stop further harbour reclamation, forcing government officials to heed alternative views on harbourfront planning, and to pay attention to non-government professionals ready to use their skills to serve the growing civil society. However, despite this early success, the progress of the case so far suggests that participation remains tokenistic, producing minimal fundamental institutional changes. Hence, professionals within and outside the government continue to face an interrelated, two-pronged challenge: how to further empower lay citizens as they seek new ways to institutionalize a more participatory mode of planning governance.},

Henri Lefebvre's `right to the city' is used to conduct a socio-spatial analysis of mixed income housing programmes, including the degree that integration increases public housing residents' access to diverse neighbourhoods, the use value of a city, and participatory space. The paper concludes that mixed income housing has the potential to increase public housing residents' `right to the city' but that policy implementers need to be proactive in the face of barriers such as community opposition to subsidized housing that can hinder the right. Future research should focus on evaluating the benefits of mixed income housing policy for neediest residents and ways to increase their rights to social, economic and political space.},

due to its relatively low costs of development among transit types and its simultaneous potential
to drive economic development. However, very little research has been conducted to understand
the economic impacts of such systems across sectors. This paper uses buffer areas around BRT
stations on nine lines opened in the mid-2000s across the U.S., and equally sized areas around
control points, to estimate the effects of BRT stations on employment growth for sectors. We
find that while our model adequately predicts overall employment change regardless of BRT,
BRT is found to influence employment change in only one sector\textemdash{}manufacturing. We believe
this finding should be encouraging to economic development planners, as manufacturing
provides an employment base for a broad spectrum of income levels, and represents a significant
share of industrial recruitment activity.},

However, many analyses are bivariate rather than multivariate and do not disentangle the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic status from that of race. Furthermore, the fringe services industry contends that market factors, such as zoning, arterials, population base, and commercial activity influence location. This study employs geographic information systems (GIS) and multiple regression to untangle the spatial relationship between minority communities and traditional and fringe banks in four small-to-moderate-sized metropolitan areas. We find that, though market factors are indeed powerful determinants of fringe bank location, there are nonetheless persistent ethnic effects in two of the four cities and these effects cannot be attributed to factors correlated with a large minority presence.},

We find that the lowest emissions areas are generally in California and that the highest emissions areas are in Texas and Oklahoma. There is a strong negative association between emissions and land use regulations. By restricting new development, the cleanest areas of the country would seem to be pushing new development towards places with higher emissions. Cities generally have significantly lower emissions than suburban areas, and the city-suburb gap is particularly large in older areas, like New York.},

Findings suggest that many of the jurisdictions that adopted performance-based planning subsequently abandoned it because of the heavy administrative burden required, and where performance methods survived, they were typically hybridized with traditional zoning. If performance-based approaches continue to be used, there is a need to better understand the administrative and implementation implications of this type of land use regulation.},

The paper presents the findings of a case study analysis that reveals how the 1970s saw differing interests lay claim to the right to determine the spatial meaning and future of city-centre industrial space. The research deconstructs the (re)production of the Grade I listed Liverpool Road Station, the first train station in the world, and its conversion into the successful Museum of Science and Industry. The conclusions show that the 1970s (re)presentation of the station site facilitated its (re)production as a site of revalorised industrial heritage. The consequences were the ``rediscovery'' of the Castlefield area of the city, and the later reimagining of post-industrial Manchester in the 1990s, which continues in the twenty-first century.},

  abstract = {One of the key agreements adopted at the Rio Conference in 1992 was the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Both in practice and research biodiversity has been mainly addressed in a non-urban context, often discussed in relation to issues such as the depletion of rainforests and desertification. However, as more than half of the world population are urban dwellers, it is increasingly urgent to discuss the application of the concept of biodiversity within an urban context. Issues approached in this article are: What does it mean to talk about biodiversity in an urban context? Is biodiversity a meaningful goal for urban politics and planning? Is there empirical evidence of implementing biodiversity in urban politics and planning. After an introduction, the article is organized into four sections. In the second section the concept of biological diversity is defined with special reference to its application in an urban context. Biodiversity and its relationship to urban governance is the topic of the third section, followed by a section analysing examples of how this relationship is practised in selected Swedish cities. The final section highlights five major conclusions with regard to the application of biodiversity in an urban context: (1) that all cities studied have adopted overall `green' policies, including biodiversity as one component; (2) that local coalitions in favour of implementing biodiversity have been established between employees at different offices, between employees and politicians, and between employees and NGOs; (3) that there are in all cases tangible signs of spatial patterns and structures that are favourable to biodiversity; (4) that urban biodiversity, for its successful implementation, needs to be related, and accommodated to other values given priority in current policymaking, such as recreation; (5) that mainstream biodiversity analysis should be complemented by an urban landscape approach. Finally, the article returns to the more general question of what biodiversity could and should mean in urban planning.},

Using the National Establishment Time Series data set and individual earnings data from the American Community Survey Public Use Microdata Sample files, this research conducts a quantile regression to estimate the earnings distribution effects that a concentration of manufacturing FDI may have on different earnings groups in Georgia between 2004 and 2010. The research does not measure inequality directly, but the findings both from place-of-work and place-of-residence earnings analyses suggest strong implications relating to the issue of inequality among people. The concentration of manufacturing FDI in a certain area shows the largest distribution effects on area workers in the lower earnings group and residents in the middle earnings group.},

The policy arena is just as contentious; a host of different strategies have been proposed to provide employment opportunities in manufacturing, particularly for low-income populations. By synthesizing the research to date and evaluating the key debates in this area, this literature review will assist economic development researchers and practitioners in making the leap to workforce issues.},

Core city borders are undergoing major transformations and the urban periphery is becoming an attractive area for investment as well as an experimental ground for planning innovation. Yet, its development entails deep political tension. This paper starts from the assumption that the role of political dynamics and political agendas of elected groups is under-investigated in today's spatial planning research, even though they are crucial in enabling innovation in times of economic change. This paper contributes to this field of research in two ways: first, it conceptualizes the political challenges for planning into three major dilemmas: over approaches to spatial investment, over regulation, and over spatial interventions in the periphery. The paper then empirically demonstrates that to address these tensions in spatial planning there is a need to consider more fundamental political issues over future city-regional agendas. Examining recent transformation efforts in Amsterdam's northwestern areas, where industrial, housing, and environmental change all conflict, the paper shows that these dilemmas are attached to broader political questions over growth strategies, the meaning of regulation, and the role of governments in land management.},

This paper presents a comprehensive framework for integrated assessment of ecological services and socio-economic benefits of natural and semi-natural ecosystems and landscapes. The framework can be applied at different scale levels to different ecosystems or landscape-units and basically consists of three steps: (1) Function-analysis: translates ecological complexity into a limited number of ecosystem (or landscape) functions, which, in turn, provide a range of goods and services; (2) Function valuation: includes ecological, socio-cultural and economic valuation methods; and (3) Conflict analysis: to facilitate the application of function-analysis and valuation at different scale levels, it is important to integrate analytical valuation methods with stakeholder participation techniques. The framework presented in this paper facilitates the structured assessment of the (total) value of the goods and services provided by a specific area (landscape) and to analyze the costs and benefits involved in trade-offs between various land use options. The last section of this paper gives some conclusions and recommendations for application-possibilities of function-analysis and valuation to achieve more sustainable landscape use and maintenance of our ``natural capital''.},

This article investigates the location of nine disaggregated manufacturing sectors in Phoenix, Arizona, showing varying degrees of central core concentration and metropolitan-wide clustering. Distinct sectoral co-location patterns are also evident. We interpret our results as evidence that the intrametropolitan location of postindustrial manufacturing is best understood as a series of spatial distributions with varying concentration, centralization, clustering, and other order-based characteristics. There is little evidence that randomly scattered discrete industrial zones have developed nor that spatial patterns are uniform. Enduring lock-in effects tied to transportation infrastructure are pivotal to understanding the locational distribution of manufacturing industries in metropolitan Phoenix. Results do not support a hypothesis that a positive relationship exists between establishment size and distance from sectoral mean centers.},

The study finds that residential segregation plays an important role in sustaining labor-market segregation among immigrants, and that gender emerges as a salient mediating factor. While living in an ethnic enclave tends to be associated with ethnic-niche employment for both men and women, women who live in enclave neighborhoods have a higher rate of ethnic-niche employment than men. However, greater geographic accessibility to niche jobs is associated with niche employment for both immigrant men and women in general, and place-based context seems as important to men as women.},

The homeless pose negative externalities to status-seekers among post-industrial consumers because they threaten the meaning systems through which the latter interpret their lives. In order to sell their commodities, the producers of post-industrial spaces and activities must create a spatially rational city; a city devoid of production and poverty. To the extent that the land-rent mechanism fails to achieve this, politicization of the expulsion of the poor is likely. Locational conflict provides a vehicle for advocates to press for public action on behalf of the homeless.},

Results derived from a latent class analysis reveal significant heterogeneity in residential location preferences. Overall, strong preferences for compact development are more likely to occur among families with fewer school-age children, low-income and renter-occupied households, and those who appreciate social heterogeneity and have less desire for privacy. These tastes are also associated with personal preferences for walking and biking and supportive opinions toward environmental protection and urban growth boundary policies. By comparing respondents' preferences to their actual residential and travel choices in two contrasting subregions, we further address the complex relationships between environment, preferences, residential locations and travel.},

A look at the relationship between PTAs and local government in Jinja, Uganda, demonstrates that the de facto decentralization of the provision of primary education to PTAs provides an opportunity for building political accountability; when parents bring resources to the table, governments must share resources and responsibility and relationships of accountability emerge. These relationships are threatened by the new universal primary education (UPE) policy for which Uganda has few resources and little accountability. Current UNESCO initiatives for establishing UPE in Sub-Saharan Africa call for participation and accountability but may ignore the potential for accountability and improvement through partnerships between governments and PTAs.},

Although urban manufacturing centres are not as central to the urban economy as they once were, they still house a vibrant and varied manufacturing sector that serves urban niche markets and provides employment for a less-educated and largely immigrant and minority workforce. As urban neighbourhoods gentrify, these manufacturers are faced with displacement because their space has become attractive to developers who convert lofts into residences. This paper looks at the process of gentrification and the experience of industrial displacement in the Williamsburg neighbourhood of Brooklyn, New York, in order to challenge existing theories on the impacts of gentrification and thus help to make clear the processes and interests at work. Through buy-outs, lease refusals, zoning changes and increasing rents, small manufacturers are being actively displaced, endangering the diversity of the economy and the employment outcomes of unskilled and immigrant workers.},

Though Portugali's vision of the role of the planner might be too polemic, what is indeed an issue is that planners are in need of new tools that will enable them to be more process orientated, more geared towards communication, and encouraging of the involvement of multiple stakeholders, etc. Computer simulation models meet these requirements, but although they have indeed been adopted in planning practice, they have not become an indispensable piece of equipment. A very different story emerges from the gaming industry where, for more than twenty years, computer games have continued to attract millions of players, and have even entered classrooms and planning practices. Not only do these games look increasingly realistic but the behaviour of the characters within them has grown ever closer to resembling actual behaviour, to the extent that some commentators have even started to propose that planners should turn into gamers. Does this make sense, or is it still a bridge too far? In the search for an answer, this paper will critically analyse two computer games: SimCity, which is a classic strategy game, and Second Life, an increasingly popular social virtual world. I will make a number of suggestions as to how these games could be upgraded into planning simulation models.},

While this is increasingly recognized in a burgeoning interdisciplinary body of literature, there remains an ongoing need to clarify and conceptualize the relationship between planning and health. This is especially the case from the perspective of built environment professionals, as they increasingly focus on health and well-being issues. The key contribution of this article is such a conceptualization\textemdash{}a framework to group and review the literature in this rapidly expanding area of research. We suggest three domains where urban planning can most effectively focus support for health and well-being. These domains address the principle risk factors for contemporary chronic disease\textemdash{}physical inactivity, obesity, and social isolation. Our framework is then used to review an evidence base that supports the development, prioritization, and implementation of healthy built environment practice. This article concludes with a critical discussion of theoretical and practical tensions identified as potential impediments to the progression of this new and exciting interdisciplinary area of research.},

This paper examines how ethical concerns have been, and are being, understood in planning, and the profound questions which are posed about past, present and future intellectual and professional priorities. It concludes that the planning community needs to rediscover its ethical voice and its confidence in the idea of planning.},

A variety of themes were deployed in arguments over time; ``fairness'' appears only in 2000.

It appealed to the professional ego of the professionals, and it built on the movement toward science in planning, on an analysis of the failures of urban renewal, and on the growing popularity of citizen participation. It was an idea that captured its time. Those who attempted advocacy planning came to transform the concept and question many of the foundations of modern planning. Understanding advocacy planning's place in the history of planning and the lessons learned may help us learn how we might respond to the continuing crises of our own time.},

The research on attainable (and not attainable) teaching outcomes with computer simulations is now fairly clear. SimCity provides a dynamic decision-making environment in which students can learn such teaching objectives as (1) systems thinking, (2) problem-solving skills, and (3) ``craft'' in the planning profession. However, SimCity has inherent weaknesses that prevent it from being a one-size-fits-all teaching tool for all students. The article concludes with a discussion on which type of students do better with SimCity.},

Second, the article looks at the interaction between firm boundaries, industrial networks, and urban space. This interaction is illustrated through an examination of three aspects of the planned district: incubators, clubhouses, and factories. The article combines recent research on the dynamics of industrial activity with historical evidence on Chicago's industrial districts.},

Firstly, it highlights particular urbanisms: how they are produced, lived and negotiated, from New York to Bogota. The articles thus draw attention to the multiplicity of urbanisms that constitute the contemporary world system, thereby disrupting the rather restricted analytics of global cities and world cities. Secondly, the articles pay careful attention to the forms of worlding at work in such urbanisms, demonstrating how the production of the urban takes place in the crucible of modernizing projects of development, regimes of immigration and governance and experiments with neoliberalism and market rule.Thirdly, this special issue seeks to explore the implications of such research and analysis for the field of ideas currently constituted as planning theory. How does the study of urbanisms allow a rigorous understanding of planning as the organization and transformation of space? How can planning theory make sense of seemingly unplanned spaces that lie outside the grid of visible order? In what ways is planning itself a worlding practice, such that models, best practices, expertise and capital circulate in transnational fashion, creating new worlds of planning common sense?},

Based on research in Christchurch, New Zealand (one of the most urbanised countries in the world), it is argued that the assimilation of social, economic and bio-physical environmental elements that gave the idea much of its original legitimacy has been reduced to a minimalist set of material and discursive `eco-friendly' denominators. As a result, only occasional glimpses of the city and its human inhabitants are caught in attempts to operationalise sustainability in urban areas. The effect is that cities, in New Zealand at least, are less liveable and less likeable than they should be. It is suggested that there is a real need to re-urbanise and rehumanise the urban sustainability agenda as a means of realising its integrative and transformative potential.},

Indirect policy tools can foster collective action around public problems by incorporating third party actors; however, it is necessary to understand the interaction between indirect tools and structural social capital. The actors involved in carrying out public objectives may depend upon the linkages between top-down and bottom-up social capital. A qualitative analysis of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 suggests indirect policy tools can foster collective reinvestment responses, but the effectiveness of indirect policy tools is contingent upon the existence of linking social capital.},

In Detroit, a higher percentage of US-born African Americans in the local labor market is actually associated with a higher probability of business ownership.

Yet within planning history, attention to regions and regionalism has waxed and waned. When practitioners, historians, and social scientists have considered regions retrospectively, they have tended to view events and endeavors as episodic; they have assigned the region to particular moments or movements (a City Beautiful, the New Deal, a ``new regionalism''), to discrete eras or decades (ecological regionalism, regional science), and to particular localities. Often those who study practice have seen regions when those they write about organized their efforts, framed their plans, implemented policies, and constituted these explicitly as regional in scale and scope. Because the attention of those who write planning history has been more periodic than comprehensive, scholars and practitioners who seek to understand the development over time of region as a concept, an ideal, and a space of analysis and intervention have turned to geography and allied disciplines for theory and empirics.},

This article argues that the flexibility, creativity, and innovation deemed to be hallmarks of the new `creative' economy are also present in more traditional manufacturing enclaves. Here I use examples drawn from New York City, perhaps the quintessential global city, to demonstrate that our understanding of creativity and innovation needs to recognize a broader spectrum of economic activity encompassing both new and traditional manufacturing. This case study is an attempt to expand the heteronomy of current urban policy that promotes gentrification and the wooing of the `creative class' as the only method of urban development.

A two-step approach towards the decoding of borders is introduced. Using a planning perspective, the article seeks to explain the various functions of borders, to examine power practices within the bordering process and to ascertain the relational geographies demarcated by different types of boundaries. It illustrates why those cross-border activities which address only the geopolitical dimension of the border tend to fail.},

Cleveland was selected because of its innovative and highly visible planning tradition, which has weaved through the main historic stages of American planning, and has served as a planning laboratory nationwide. The article investigates whether a postmodern planning transition in Cleveland is detectable and what its key aspects and contradictions are. It concludes that the postmodern shift in Cleveland is notably stronger in planning discourses than in planning policies. In so doing, the article demonstrates a key characteristic of the postmodern shift generally and in terms of planning, more specifically, that postmodernism is still more about a shift in attitudes than in actions.},

It does so by focusing on an incident that occurred on the bridge to Gretna when a group of New Orleanians tried to escape their flooded city in August 2005. After scrutinizing three ways (the Scientist's, the Technician's, and the Phroneticist's) in which social scientists and others typically try to make sense out of particular cases, the paper suggests that the meaning of an event depends most crucially on how diverse stories and arguments about the event interact within place-based webs of relationships. Recognizing the crucial role that circulating stories play, social scientists could combine social scientific and humanities-based skills to generate ``superior stories'' that can transform understandings and facilitate better collective action. This would involve subjecting individual stories to a close reading, juxtaposing stories against one another, and linking the stories to key contextual features. Doing so in the case of the Gretna Bridge incident reveals five important contextual features that forced New Orleanians to undergo a ``trial by space'': the contestable meaning of ``racism'', the national news media's role in exacerbating fears, the emotional truth of factually suspect claims, the hyper-segregated pattern of residence in the New Orleans city-region, and the relationship between fear and the imprisonment of young black men.},

Inclusive and equitable processes are recognised as an ideal in much planning theory and practice, yet this ideal is increasingly difficult to realise in today's societies that comprise diverse and multiple publics. Within the wider sustainability debate, ``New Urbanism'' has emerged as a pragmatic alternative to conventional low-density development. Concomitant with a range of prescribed physical outcomes, the New Urbanism movement advocates a process of ``citizen-based participatory planning and design''. Charrettes, with urban design workshops, are the favoured tools for achieving this goal. However, it is argued that the adherence to a single type of participatory tool can be inconsistent with accepted ideals of participation processes and has several implications. Of particular concern is the role of the charrette planner or facilitator, a figure who has the potential to manipulate the public because of his/her inevitable allegiance to the New Urban agenda. In addition, the examination of a charrette process in a small New Zealand town raises several broader questions about the ability of the approach to address issues of inclusiveness and the recognition of difference, two fundamental elements of good participatory processes.},

  abstract = {Although the U.S. economy of the early twenty-first century is vastly different from the U.S. economy prior to the 1970s, the nature of these economic changes and their impact on U.S. workers is unclear. This article claims that despite contemporary economic shifts, differential labor and employer power continues to segment the economy, and workers' position in the labor market continues to predict their rewards, beyond the effects of gender, race, and human capital. Drawing on segmented labor market and dual economy research, we propose a four-category model of the structural factors that influence variance in work-related rewards. We examine the distribution of jobs in each of four categories between 1974 and 2000 and observe that losses and gains across categories are unevenly distributed by race and gender. While white men have experienced the greatest declines in employment and earnings, they have maintained their absolute advantage over women and nonwhites. In multivariate analyses, we find that the structural position of employment continues to be a significant determinant of wages. Although women and racial minorities have experienced sizable increases in employment in primary labor market jobs in the core of the economy, both groups remain overrepresented in low-paying jobs. Moreover women, but not nonwhite men, consistently receive significantly fewer rewards for their labor in both low-paying and high-paying jobs. Our findings suggest that structural factors continue to influence earnings inequality, especially across race and gender lines.},

  abstract = {The turbulence which characterized the 1980s created uncertainty as to the role and purpose of planning in liberal democracies. Instrumental rationality is no longer defensible as a guiding doctrine and major questions arise concerning the relationship of planning to the market economy and the political process. The realization that the problems confronting planners are not amenable to technocratic solutions has led to recognition of the political and therefore essentially ethical nature of the planning activity. However, whilst there is widespread recognition that fundamental ethical dilemmas underpin both planning practice and theory, little explicit consideration has been given to the nature of the normative frameworks available. The purpose of this paper is to critically review the ethical frames of reference implied in the most influential theories within planning and to evaluate their relevance to practice. The paper highlights the extent to which debate has been, and continues to be, dominated by procedural questions, the rejection of universalism in favour of relativity and subjectivity, and a focus on individual interests rather than more general concern with the common good. Reluctance to engage with debates of a more foundational nature concerning ends and values is questioned and planning theorists are urged to reconnect with the fundamental issue of planning's contribution to the creation of desirable futures.\textemdash{}Les troubles et difficult{\'e}s des ann{\'e}es quatre-vingt ont cr{\'e}{\'e} une incertitude quant au r{\^o}le et aux objectifs de la planification dans les d{\'e}mocracies lib{\'e}rales.

While markets had served important social functions in addition to food, the consensus among postwar agricultural experts, downtown business leaders, and city planners was that urban food markets were slums associated with high prices, unsanitary conditions, and underperforming real estate. Market redevelopment was motivated by desires to increase land values and assert middle-class values and social norms in addition to concerns about efficiency and public safety. Public authorities and nonprofit organizations like the Greater Philadelphia Movement influenced the planning around Dock Street. Demolishing aging inner-city markets created large tracts of land coveted by postwar city planners for development of residential and commercial amenities like Society Hill that they hoped would lure the middle class back to the city. Unobstructed land that could be obtained cheaply and enclosed entirely like former trash dumps and underperforming industrial areas on the urban periphery were recommended sites for construction of new markets. This case study offers a relevant historical context for the causes of modern urban food desserts.},

The Federal Housing Act's 701 planning grant program reflected the concerns and attitudes of the first half of the 20th century, and that template shaped America's suburbs, accounting for three-quarters of the nation's growth between 1950 and 2000. The realities of the 21st century are different: Our newest public health concerns relate to low-density, single-purpose development, not the dangers of density; only about a quarter of all households will have children in 2025; and public sentiment increasingly favors integrating land uses. Changes like ' these will drive the rebuilding of much of America's built environment. For planning to succeed in this new era, I argue that we must understand future demand across all land uses, realistically assess opportunities for redeveloping existing urbanized areas, remove constraints on land use that are inconsistent with modern planning goals, and champion the financial incentives and institutional changes that will make it possible to meet future needs.},

Through an in-depth study of small-scale manufacturers in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, in New York City, we examine the extent to which and the ways in which local policy undermines otherwise healthy locally oriented businesses. We find that the City's assumption that urban manufacturing is a dying breed becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, largely via the City's own treatment of its manufacturing businesses. Through a lack of enforcement of zoning codes, zoning variances and rezoning initiatives, and more quotidian policies of harassment over noise and other quality of life complaints, the City is making it more difficult to do business for small-scale manufacturers. These policies then create a conventional wisdom that sees the City as a difficult place to start and grow a business.},

A survey of planners (both practitioners and academics) and other urban professionals has sought to identify small metropolitan regions considered to have successful downtowns and the factors associated with this success. Only a small number of such North American metropolitan regions were perceived as possessing a very successful or successful downtown. Factors that characterize such success are described. We conclude that revitalization policies should concentrate on niche markets that show little interest in homogenized suburban activities. More specifically, planners should focus on the retention and enhancement of the distinct physical characteristics that clearly distinguish downtowns from suburban environments.},

The question is addressed by analysing planning of large urban projects as a ``framing'' practice, intended in a dual sense: as a practice defining arenas and forms of interaction, and as a practice conveying ideas, visions, concepts of ``urbanity''. The case study presented\textemdash{}the Zuidas in Amsterdam\textemdash{}is interpreted as the scene of conflicting frames about the ``public'' meaning of places and as the contradictory struggle for framing collective action by means of innovative planning concepts.

It aims to analyse and evaluate the adoption of participatory structures and processes within Israel's strategic master planning systems. Existing planning laws and traditions, socio-political forces, attitudes of planning leadership and affected populations, geographical settings and other spatial factors are examined for their impact upon the participatory process. In three cases selected for study, a variety of techniques were used to secure the desired information and to test the effectiveness of the structures for involving the public. Two of the cases involve public participation as an input into the planning process. The third is an initial effort at a collaborative form of stakeholder involvement. The findings document the failure of the planning system and its bureaucracy to integrate these processes effectively. An overriding question throughout the analysis is what in the Israeli political and socio-cultural context enhances or inhibits effective participation?},

Empirical evidence indicates that land use density, diversity and design affect travel demand in urban areas both directly and indirectly.},

  abstract = {In 1925, a Cleveland, Ohio, Jewish orphanage brought the first federal lawsuit involving zoning and religious discrimination. The case was Cleveland Jewish Orphan Home v. Village of University Heights. It is historically significant because it documents how federal courts treated a local government's application of its zoning regulations for anti-Semitic purposes, the darker side of American land-use controls. This article describes the controversy over the proposed relocation of the home from the city of Cleveland to the village of University Heights, a then-small community of five hundred, and the Village's decision to deny the necessary zoning approval. It follows the litigation through the federal district court, the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the U.S. Supreme Court. The article chronicles the village's continuing efforts to impede construction of the home by blocking the provision of a public school for the orphans after it had lost the federal case. It concludes with a commentary on the broader themes of the litigation, including its importance to planning law as an early recognition of the arbitrary and exclusionary dimensions of zoning, particularly as it affected the substantive due process rights of a religious-based social service organization.},

  abstract = {This essay highlights key themes of the five essays that comprise this special issue of the Journal of Planning History on the post-Interstate Era. It outlines in broad strokes the role of highway engineers and politicians in planning and financing the Interstate Highway System. The Interstates had a positive impact on economic growth and automobility, yet citizens groups in many cities challenged route decisions that destroyed neighborhoods and damaged sensitive environments. By the early 1970s, when the Interstate System was mostly completed, Congress opened up the Highway Trust Fund for mass transit alternatives. However, our authors emphasize the persistence of conflict over transportation planning and policy. Construction of late-developing Interstate segments in cities such as St. Paul, Minnesota and Huntsville, Alabama revived the freeway revolt, but unsuccessfully. Highway planners and policy experts developed controversial new strategies for moving traffic, as in Boston's ``Big Dig,'' or for creative transportation financing, as with the Chicago Skyway and the Pennsylvania Turnpike. By the end of the twentieth century, planners and politicians in some cities sought to reverse poor route decisions of an earlier era by tearing down elevated freeway segments most judged ugly, onerous, and unnecessary. In the twenty-first century, the engineers, planners, and politicians who control the Interstate Highway System face new challenges as the aging highway infrastructure requires rebuilding and retrofitting in an era of economic decline and political cost cutting.},

It questions the normative capacity of collaborative planning in societies where place is imbued with multiple political, social and ethnic meanings. Using research data from Belfast, it identifies a number of challenges to discursive practice, namely the understanding of `place' and how it is constructed, the emotional qualities attached to territory and the way in which professionalized policy routines moderate participatory practice. The article goes on to argue that space is being reinterpreted via statutory equality, human rights and social needs legislation, which have placed further strain on planners and planning policy in the city. However, it concludes by emphasizing the potential of collaborative planning to animate equality and social inclusion and give direction to the profession and practice in areas long divided by poverty and ethnic division. For this to happen, collaborative practice needs to inform the plan-making process from formulation to implementation and not be limited to fairly selective public consultation exercises.},

Examining projects in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Jose, California, the article illustrates that much more than impressive architecture influences their catalytic ability.

Advanced countries specialized in the generation and exploitation of knowledge because of its relative abundance stemming from their sophisticated knowledge governance mechanisms and the large stock of knowledge. In turn, this had strong positive effects on total factor productivity. The empirical analysis confirms that in advanced economies the specialization in knowledge-based activities substituted for the previous specialization in mass manufacturing activities supporting the increase of total factor productivity. The new specialization in knowledge-intensive activities has been stronger in cases where patent activities have been more intense and the exposure to international trade and the revenue per capita have been larger.},

Limited attention has been paid to how residential mortgage foreclosures in a neighborhood are related to households' socioeconomic status and mobility decisions and, thus, lead to overall neighborhood change. We use sheriff's foreclosure sales data in Cuyahoga County between 1983 and 1989 to predict changes in neighborhood indicators from 1990 to 2000, controlling for various neighborhood and census place indicators and their changes. Results suggest that higher foreclosure rates are positively related to changes in percentage black population, female headship rate, median household income, and unemployment rate. We thus conclude that foreclosures speed up the housing filtering process, and racial and economic turnover of residents. Our results will enable planners and policy makers to understand the transitional process of these neighborhoods so that they can be stabilized in the years following concentrated foreclosures.},

In September 1970, when Meyerson assumed the presidency, he found Penn at a critical juncture. ``Franklin's University'' roiled with serious financial and relational problems, some inherited from his predecessor, Gaylord Harnwell, many of them emanating from accelerating trends in the larger society, such as a downward spiraling economy, an escalating urban crisis and heightened racial tensions, and a youth culture that was increasingly self-referential in its lack of political concerns. The era of Penn's great expansion was over; yet while physical growth had been successfully accomplished, there was little integration of the departmental, disciplinary, and student activities housed in the new or renovated buildings, and the historic core of the campus remained without a landscape design. Meyerson's embrace of ``One University'' promised to remedy such academic fragmentation and factionalism, which in his judgment impeded Penn's advance into the pantheon of the world's leading research universities. This essay looks look closely at Meyerson's handling of these crises, his juggling of the various tensions involved, his administration's design for the beautification of Penn's campus, and in the final analysis, the enduring strengths and significant limitations of his program to achieve ``One University''.},

  abstract = {The process by which students decide whether and where to attend college has been based most commonly on a college-choice model that is independent of the students' geographic context. However, the ability to attend college close to home is often among the most important factors that U.S. high school students, especially minorities and the socioeconomically disadvantaged, consider. The study presented here mapped the place of residence of a national sample of high school seniors, as well as the location of all colleges within commuting distance of each student, and showed that seniors have a wide range of colleges in proximity. Furthermore, after taking account of important student and zip code-level factors, the study found that each additional college in proximity is associated with a small but significant increase in the odds of applying to college, especially a four-year college. These findings suggest that researchers should stop treating the college-choice process as though it were independent of location and start situating this process within the geographic context in which it occurs.},

The outcome of the case is explained by the powerful influence of a value network of ornithologists, with particular inside activists of that network playing important roles in presenting a challenge to development of the area.

Both theory and practice are dominated by ambivalence about the idea of participation itself. Both struggle with dilemmas that make the problems seem insoluble, such as the conflict between the individual and collective interest or between the ideal of democracy and the reality that many voices are never heard. Cases are used to draw on an emerging set of practices of collaborative public engagement from around the world to demonstrate how alternative methods can better meet public participation goals and how they make moot most of the dilemmas of more conventional practice. Research shows that collaborative participation can solve complex, contentious problems such as budget decision making and create an improved climate for future action when bitter disputes divide a community. Authentic dialogue, networks and institutional capacity are the key elements. The authors propose that participation should be understood as a multi-way set of interactions among citizens and other players who together produce outcomes. Next steps involve developing an alternative practice framework, creating forums and arenas, adapting agency decision processes, and providing training and financial support.},

In other cases, the principles seem to be reformulated in response to the realities of local planning. This article first reviews smart growth statements from ten national organizations with divergent land use agendas. Despite their differing agendas, their broad conceptual definitions are found to converge. Turning to implementation efforts, the article then reviews forty-nine documents from two states: Georgia and Kentucky. The documents exhibit extreme variety in the meanings ascribed to smart growth. Moreover, few of the plans and policies incorporate multiple interventions, which is a key dimension of the smart growth approach as described by the national groups.},

  abstract = {The article reaches two conclusions counter to accepted transportation engineering theory. First, the traffic environments of dense urban areas appear to be safer than the lower-volume environments of the suburbs. The reason is that many fewer miles are driven on a per capita basis, and the driving that is done is at lower speeds that are less likely to produce fatal crashes. Second, at least in dense urban areas, less-``forgiving'' design treatments\textemdash{}such as narrow lanes, traffic-calming measures, and street trees close to the roadway\textemdash{}appear to enhance a roadway's safety performance when compared to more conventional roadway designs. The reason for this apparent anomaly may be that less-forgiving designs provide drivers with clear information on safe and appropriate operating speeds.},

This `job chains' model is an analytic framework for assessing the employment impacts associated with economic development programs and the social value of those impacts. The approach focuses on measuring the wage gains to job changers and placing realistic values on jobs for those not previously employed in the area. It explicitly considers both efficiency and distributional effects of job creation. We discuss the simple mechanics of the technique and present an example relating to the establishment of a large auto plant in a major Midwestern city. We conclude with practical ground rules for planners carrying out a job chains analysis of an economic development effort.},

The results of an analysis of regional climate and ozone formation during the 1990s indicate that annual violations of the national ozone standard were more strongly associated with regional temperatures than with the emissions of regulated ozone precursors from mobile and stationary sources. Based on the results of this analysis, I argue that the air quality management strategies outlined in the Clean Air Act may be insufficient to control ozone formation due to ongoing and unanticipated changes in global and regional climate. I further argue that the emergence of urban heat as a significant air "pollutant" demands a strategic response from the field of urban planning. The article concludes with a discussion of the linkages between urban form and regional temperature and outlines a set of design strategies that have proven successful in mitigating urban heat production.},

The paper concludes by emphasising that the institutional learning approach is not a panacea, but does provide a valuable window into strategic efforts to ``see'' urban areas in different\textemdash{}that is, more sustainable\textemdash{}ways. Ultimately, it is the quality of these democratic deliberations that will make attempts at transformative change for sustainability over the long-term both substantive and worthwhile.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.landurbplan.2009.10.003},
  abstract = {Green infrastructure is a popular framework for conservation planning. The main elements of green infrastructure are hubs and links. Hubs tend to be large areas of `natural' vegetation and links tend to be linear features (e.g., streams) that connect hubs. Within the United States, green infrastructure projects can be characterized as: (1) reliant on classical geographic information system (GIS) techniques (e.g., overlay, buffering) for mapping; (2), mainly implemented by states and local jurisdictions; and (3) static assessments that do not routinely incorporate information on land-cover change. We introduce morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) as a complementary way to map green infrastructure, extend the geographic scope to the conterminous United States, and incorporate land-cover change information. MSPA applies a series of image processing routines to a raster land-cover map to identify hubs, links, and related structural classes of land cover. We identified approximately 4000 large networks (\&gt;100 hubs) within the conterminous United States, of which approximately 10\% crossed state boundaries. We also identified a net loss of up to 3.59 million ha of links and 1.72 million ha of hubs between 1992 and 2001. Our national assessment provides a backbone that states could use to coordinate their green infrastructure projects, and our incorporation of change illustrates the importance of land-cover dynamics for green infrastructure planning and assessment.},

The country has a long planning tradition, and a constant focus on public health work, so if an integration of health promotion and planning were to succeed, it would most likely be in Norway. This article focuses on the current state of affairs by addressing the following questions: What are the national ambitions concerning health in planning, and how is planning thought to promote health? How are national ambitions translated into local planning in Norwegian municipalities? What are the prospects for further integration between health and urban planning? The intersection between national ambitions and local practices is studied by analysing core national policy documents, survey data from a lateral section of Norwegian municipalities, and qualitative interviews with core actors at the local level. This paper fills a gap in urban planning research, where broad studies of the integration of public health issues at the local level are rare. Its analysis reveals that healthy urban planning has not yet been achieved, even in Norway. There is little knowledge transfer and interaction between planners and public health coordinators, and it has proven difficult to incorporate public health themes that are out of rhythm with planning's traditional focus. However, the activities of thirty municipalities at the forefront of healthy planning show promising signs and there are elements in current planning that may help build towards a healthy urban planning in future.},

First, recent policy innovations have spurred cleanup and redevelopment on many of the counties' least contaminated sites and those located in the strongest markets. Second, brownfield remediation is a necessary but not sufficient precursor to redevelopment and job creation. Many of the U.S. brownfield sites are located in weak land markets; thus, cleanup does not necessarily result in follow-on private investment. Third, brownfield redevelopment is complicated by the fact that many of the most seriously contaminated sites are located in the most distressed neighborhoods. Redevelopment and job creation, therefore, are likely to require substantial government investment. Finally, experiments that tie job creation to local residents have received little study but show promise as the best way to avoid displacement when remediation and redevelopment are successful.},

Space matters not only in terms of defining one's access to the polis, but also as a deadly tool through which police killings, economic marginalization, and mass incarceration produce the very geographies (here referred to as ``the black necropolis'') that the state aims to counteract in its war against the black urban poor. Yet, within the context of necropolitical governance, blackness appears as a spatially grounded praxis that enables victims of state terror to reclaim their placeless location as a political resource for redefining themselves and the polis.},

This article aims to contribute to that discussion by examining ongoing changes in the management of public spaces across England and analysing how local authorities are responding to English government policies and initiatives that explicitly link the quality of public spaces, especially ordinary streets and squares, to a broader urban policy agenda. Looking at the way centrally defined policy initiatives are taking root at local level, and on the basis of an extensive survey of current and emerging public space management practices in England, the article makes the case for an understanding of changes in the nature of public space and its governance that is better anchored in the institutional context in which those changes take place. It also suggests that a policy focus on the quality of ordinary public spaces, with its implicit assumptions on how their users perceive quality and react to it, is creating a new field of policy with its own stakeholders, power relations, and governance mechanisms.},

The surveyed employers made widespread use not only of regular part-time workers but also of short-term hires, on-call workers, agency temporaries, and contract workers. Two-thirds expected flexible staffing use to increase in their industry in the near future. Most commonly cited as reasons for using all types of flexible staffing arrangements were the needs to adjust for workload fluctuations and staff absences. Many employers also used agency temporaries and part-time workers to screen workers for regular positions. In addition, the survey evidence points to savings on benefits costs as an important factor in employers' decisions to use most flexible arrangements. The author examines the implications of why employers use the various types of flexible staffing arrangements for workers and public policy.},

Of critical importance is the changing distribution of workplaces, and their relation, through the journey-to-work, to residential patterns. In the early-twentieth century, urban growth depended upon manufacturing. Following an era of mergers, corporations reorganized production and moved factories to the urban fringe. Jobs drew blue-collar workers into the suburbs, where lax building regulations enabled many to acquire homes by building their own. These processes were most evident in young industrial cities, but they also reshaped older centres such as New York City. For New York City, and exceptional combination of sources make it possible to disentangle the changing distribution of workplaces, homes, and commuting patterns through the first half of this century. Office growth pushed manufacturing out of the centre, but this trend was resisted by the inertia of fixed capital investments, and by a distinctive mix of labour-intensive industries. In this context topography, and a new subway system, presented a peculiar set of residential opportunities to New York's work force. Unlike most North American cities, in New York clerical and skilled blue-collar workers moved to the boroughs while a "modern" situation of social polarization had emerged in Manhattan by 1940.},

The study empirically examines the implementation of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in Los Angeles and compares its spatial characteristics with the public investments associated with the place-based Enterprise Zone (EZ) program. Findings show that the EITC represents a significantly greater, though unintended, investment in poor neighborhoods than does the EZ and suggest new scholarly research and policy directions.},

Estimates of the total jobs created as well as the average number of jobs created per million dollars spent are provided. The study shows that the 50 ARRA projects administered by NOAA in the first year and half generated a total of 1409 jobs. These habitat restoration projects created, on average, 17 jobs per million dollars spent which is similar to other conservation industries such as parks and land conservation, and much higher than other traditional industries including coal, gas, and nuclear energy generation. This suggests that habitat restoration is indeed an effective way to stimulate job creation. In addition, habitat restoration has longer-term economic benefits, including future job creation in rebuilt fisheries and coastal tourism, and benefits to coastal economies including higher property values and better water quality. Therefore, investing in blue infrastructure habitat restoration is a green opportunity benefiting coastal economies and societies in both the short and the long term.},

  abstract = {Implementation of urban heat island (UHI) mitigation strategies such as increased vegetative cover and higher-albedo surface materials can reduce the impacts of biophysical hazards in cities, including heat stress related to elevated temperatures, air pollution and associated public health effects. Such strategies also can lower the demand for air-conditioning-related energy production. Since local impacts of global climate change may be intensified in areas with UHIs, mitigation strategies could play an increasingly important role as individuals and communities adapt to climate change. We use CITYgreen, a GIS-based modeling application, to estimate the potential benefits of urban vegetation and reflective roofs as UHI mitigation strategies for case study sites in and around Newark and Camden, New Jersey.

The analysis showed that urban vegetation can reduce health hazards associated with the UHI effect by removing pollutants from the air. Less affluent, inner-city neighborhoods are the ones in which the hazard potential of the UHI effect is shown to be greatest. However, these neighborhoods have less available open space for tree planting and therefore a lower maximum potential benefit. As the climate warms, these neighborhoods may face greater consequences due to interactions between the UHI effect and global climate change. Results also show that urban vegetation is an effective and economically efficient way to reduce energy consumption and costs at the sites.},

This paper proposes that three normative theories \textendash{} theories of action \textendash{} underlay this activity, as they underlie the practice of neighbourhood regeneration or ``community development'' planning in the USA in general. These theories of action are based, respectively, on planners' perceived need for the reinstitution of civil norms, capital markets, and social justice in disinvested areas of cities and regions. Each theory links description with prescription, answering both the question ``What's going on in this neighbourhood? (and why?)'' and the question ``What ought to be done to change it?''. While an outward d{\'e}tente prevails among the ``norms'', ``markets'', and ``justice'' approaches, conflicts among them go to the heart of the struggle to find effective, morally acceptable policy responses to environmental deterioration and human deprivation in urban neighbourhoods.},

By comparing two cases of community planning in Seattle, Washington, and Matsudo, Japan, this article examines the role of informal processes in overcoming institutional and social barriers and negotiating differences of identities, values, and interests. The article argues that, through animated interactions, building of trust, experiential learning, and spontaneity, informal activities and processes can serve as important vehicles for creating meanings, social relationships, and collective actions and enable planners to navigate the cultural and political terrain of community differences.},

Because of the prominence of skylines in the urban landscape, their regulation represents a prime candidate for applying design guidelines. We tested guidelines for three prospective skyline factors: overall skyline shape (convex, concave, or flat), number of turns in the roofline of individual buildings (4, 8, or 12), and level of variance in four attributes of individual buildings: height, width, depth, and setback (low, medium, or high). Level of variance in building attributes had the strongest effect on judged pleasantness. The respondents preferred rugged skylines over simple ones, whatever their overall shape. These findings suggest that regulations for skyline appearance should focus on variances in the four building attributes.},

  doi = {10.1177/0019793916660067},
  abstract = {Recent economic events have sparked debates over the degree of structural mismatch in the U.S. economy. One of the most frequent claims is that workers lack the skills that employers demand. The existing literature, however, analyzes this potential mismatch at a high level of aggregation with abstract indices and noisy proxies that obscure the underlying mechanisms. The authors address these issues by presenting and analyzing results from a survey of U.S. manufacturing establishments. The survey is the first, to their knowledge, to directly measure concrete employer skill demands and hiring experiences in a nationally representative survey at the industry level. The findings indicate that demand for higher-level skills is generally modest, and that three-quarters of manufacturing establishments do not show signs of hiring difficulties. Among the remainder, demands for higher-level math and reading skills are significant predictors of long-term vacancies, but demands for computer skills and other critical-thinking/problem-solving skills are not. Of particular interest, high-tech plants do not experience greater levels of hiring challenges. When the authors examine the potential mechanisms that could contribute to hiring difficulties, they find that neither external regional supply conditions nor internal firm practices are predictive of hiring problems. Rather, the data show that establishments that are members of clusters or that demand highly specialized skills have the greatest probability of incurring long-term vacancies. The authors interpret these results as a sign that it is important to think about factors that complicate the interaction of supply and demand\textemdash{}such as disaggregation and communication/coordination failures\textemdash{}rather than simply focusing on inadequate labor supply.},

Prior to the crisis, political-economic conceptions of neoliberalism as a hegemonic grid and as a relatively robust regime of state-facilitated market rule were being received with growing skepticism by some poststructural critics, while some ethnographers found the accompanying conceptual tools rather too blunt for their methodological purposes. The fact, however, that the global crisis\textemdash{}far from marking an inauspicious end to the regime of market rule\textemdash{}seems to have brought about something like a redoubling of its intensity and reach has prompted a reconsideration, in some quarters, of the explanatory and political status of neoliberalism. This, in turn, has opened up some new avenues of dialog between structural and poststructural treatments of neoliberalism, and between ethnographic and political-economic approaches, while at the same time highlighting a series of continuing tensions, both epistemological and ontological. The paper provides a critical commentary on this emerging terrain.},

  abstract = {The use of scenario planning in urban and regional planning practice has grown in the last decade as one way to face uncertainty. However, in adapting scenario planning from its origins in the business sector, planners have eliminated two key components: (1) the use of multiple scenarios, and (2) the inclusion of diverse organizations, people, and interests through deep deliberations. We argue that this shift limits the ability of planners to plan for multiple plausible futures that are shaped by an increasing number of diverse actors. In this paper, we use case-study research to examine how uncertainty was considered in four scenario-planning processes. We analyzed and compared the cases based on analytical categories related to multiple futures and diversity. We found that the processes that used multiple, structurally distinct scenarios explored a wider range of topics and issues shaping places. All four relied heavily on professional stakeholders as the scenario developers, limiting public input. Only one of the processes that included multiple futures captured the differential effects that scenarios would have on diverse people and interests. Overall, the purpose of the scenario planning drove the participant diversity and ultimately the quality and use of the scenarios.},

While remote sensing data have been used in urban modeling and analysis for some time, the proposed combination of remote sensing and spatial metrics for that purpose is quite novel. Starting with a review of recent developments in each of these fields, we show how the systematic, combined use of these tools can contribute an important new level of information to urban modeling and urban analysis in general. We claim that the proposed approach leads to an improved understanding and representation of urban dynamics and helps to develop alternative conceptions of urban spatial structure and change. The theoretical argument is then illustrated with actual examples from the urban area of Santa Barbara, California. Some questions for future research are finally put forward to help strengthen the potential of the proposed framework, especially regarding the further exploration of urban dynamics at different geographic scales.},

Industries have similar clustering patterns even in very different cities. Using Bureau of Labor Statistics data, we conducted geographic information systems (GIS) analysis to compare cultural industries in Los Angeles and New York City, two cities with very different types of geography and urban environments. Two distinct findings emerged: (1) when cultural industries are disaggregated into distinct industrial subsectors (art, fashion, music, design), important differences among them emerge; and (2) cultural industries ``behave'' similarly in each city because their subsectors tend to colocate (e.g., art with design; music with film) in similar ways, and this colocation pattern remains consistent in both locations. Such notable clustering tendencies of cultural industries help inform future research and further enlighten our understanding of their location patterns.},

A major portion of each one of these brochures attempted to demonstrate the blighted conditions that prevailed in the area to be redeveloped. These sections included maps, statistics, descriptions, and photographs. Moses wanted to keep the texts in the brochures short and allow the photographs and the illustrations to demonstrate the shortcomings of the areas designated as slums. This article analyzes the photographs that appeared in the ``Demonstration of Slum Conditions'' (later renamed to ``Demonstration of Blight'') section of the brochures and raises a number of questions concerning the process and the paradigm under which Moses's slum clearance organization was operating. Both the process and the paradigm of slum clearance in New York City involved elected officials, planning commissioners, and even the judiciary.},

Only four of the seven plans issued experienced any implementation during the study period, and of those four plans, only one had more than half of its recommendations implemented. Incremental implementation occurred when unimplemented plan ideas were proposed by later plans and subsequently realized.},

University administrators pursued an ambitious agenda of redevelopment and neighborhood management in South East Chicago in order to fight a wave of racial transition. In doing so, the university formed and led a coalition of top urban universities that shared real estate practices and helped create federal policy that made universities integral parts of urban renewal initiatives in the 1960s. This effort to create, manage, and redevelop housing, including student housing, provoked strident opposition from the student body and set the emerging New Left against the university in an early salvo of the student movement.},

  abstract = {The body of knowledge on transport and land use planning shows considerable overlap with management theories and practices. Notable examples can be found in project management and strategic management. Recently, in the field of management theory, the idea of programme management has gained prominence in response to the need to coordinate on a tactical level. Programme management links to both strategic management and project management, as it focuses on the coordinated management of related projects in order to realize strategic objectives. In line with the tradition to integrate management theories into spatial planning, the aim of this paper is to explore the power of a programme management approach in a transport and land use planning context. We investigate whether and how a programme management approach when applied in transport and land use planning can deal with three important interrelated challenges that emerge between the strategic and operational level in transport and land use planning: (1) linking strategic goals to operational projects, (2) developing the accompanying joint organizational structures, and (3) moulding fixed and separate procedures into more adaptive joint decision-making processes. To do so, we conducted an in-depth case study of two recent programme management approaches in Dutch transport and land use planning. We show that both programmes function as platforms where different parties come together and where a wide range of management and monitoring tools are used to guide the programme in a specific direction.},

Using fixed effects models with data from the Bureau of Labour Statistics and the Census Bureau, the paper examines the influence of industrial diversity and concentration on unemployment rate stability in Ohio counties between 1977 and 2011. Results indicate that while more concentrated counties had lower unemployment rates when times were good, counties with more diverse industry structures fared better during times of national or local employment shocks. The paper also finds that there is a relationship between concentration in particular industries and the ability to withstand a shock changes over the 35 years examined, thus highlighting the need to take care when interpreting findings over shorter periods and the need to consider the particular industry of dependence. While local policymakers have little ability to affect industrial concentration in the short run, the paper recommends that highly concentrated counties adopt policies that may help buffer their economies to effects of negative shocks.},

  abstract = {Nearly all transportation policy debates concern money, and nearly all transportation finance debates concern equity. To some, this second assertion may seem puzzling, even counterintuitive. But the way public officials think of equity in transportation finance is far different from that of most social scientists or transportation planners. Equity gets defined differently by different interests at different times. This article examines transportation pricing and finance equity from a variety of perspectives to clarify what can be a fuzzy and confusing issue. The authors distinguish transportation finance and pricing equity from other forms of transportation equity and then discuss several competing theories of equity long debated by social philosophers. These theories serve as a basis for understanding the complex and often inconsistent notions of fairness that the public and elected officials have regarding the distribution of public resources and particularly transportation investments. Given these competing theories of equity, the authors argue that most conflicts over transportation pricing and finance are rooted in philosophical differences over justice and equity and differing notions of the appropriate units of analysis\textemdash{}individuals, groups, or jurisdictions\textemdash{}for evaluating equity. Accordingly, the authors offer an analytical framework to help planners and policy makers untangle these two issues. This framework transcends the philosophical characterizations of equity to allow for a more practical consideration of transportation finance and pricing fairness. They conclude with a discussion of the lessons offered by some recent debates in transportation pricing and finance for decision makers searching for a fair price for transportation.},

  abstract = {This paper builds on work which celebrates insurgent planning practices, and which recognises the possibilities for repression inherent within these. Calling for more attention to the practice of so-called repressive insurgencies, it uses two case studies from Durban, South Africa to unsettle some assumptions arguably embedded in notions of ``anti-democratic'' or repressive insurgency. The cases tell the stories of marginalised women who participate through insurgency in shaping their city. Their contributions to resolving unmet housing and employment needs represent acts of insurgency against a state which has, in part, retreated from the provision of shelter and employment through its commitment to a neoliberal agenda. These insurgent practices parallel other celebrated insurgent contributions to cities. The women, however, also manage crime and violence in their local areas, using a range of strategies, some of which can be considered insurgent, as they directly challenge the authority and competence of the state. These crime management practices are, however, at times very violent, as the women's insurgent practices involve forms of vigilantism to achieve their purposes. Yet given the marginalised status of the women, and the reality of an absent state, trying to make sense of these practices (from the perspective of planning theory) proves challenging. Labelling them anti-democratic and repressive is arguably inadequate. The paper makes use of this contradiction to unsettle the concept of insurgency and develop further ideas about the difficulties of celebrating or condemning the contributions of the marginalised to diverse and unequal cities.},

  abstract = {* Concomitant with the rise in the proportion of the global human population that resides in urban areas has been growth in awareness of the importance of the provision of ecosystem goods and services to those people. Urban areas are themselves of significance in this regard because of their areal extent, and hence the quantity of services falling within their bounds, and because of the need for local provision of services to urban residents.

* Here, we review key challenges to the effective management of ecosystem goods and services within urban areas.

* These challenges include the structure of green space, its temporal dynamics, spatial constraint on ecosystem service flows, occurrence of novel forms of flows, large numbers of land managers, conflicting management goals, possible differences between perceptions of urban dwellers and the reality of the distribution and flow of ecosystem services, and the `wicked' nature of the problem of ecosystem service management.

*
Synthesis and applications. Urban areas present very particular combinations of challenges and opportunities for the management of ecosystem goods and services. The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of green spaces greatly complicates the maintenance and improvement in service provision as well as dramatically inflating costs. Spatial constraints on ecosystem service flows mean that these can be highly dependent on the maintenance of particular areas of connectivity, but also that provision of additional key points of connectivity may be disproportionately beneficial to those flows. The existence of novel forms of flows of ecosystem services in urban areas offers means of overcoming spatial constraints on more natural flows, but will require the development of new kinds of ecosystem process models to inform their design and management. The large numbers of land managers, conflicts between the best approaches for managing for different goods and services, and frequent differences between the perceptions of urban dwellers and the reality of urban landscapes create a complex management context. The management of ecosystem goods and services is closely allied to the challenges of conventional urban planning. However, applied ecology has a broad range of tools available to assist in determining solutions, including the use of high-resolution remote sensing techniques, landscape ecology principles and theory (e.g. patch and matrix frameworks, meta-population models), and systematic conservation planning approaches.},

This paper uses the case of small-scale providers in Can Tho, Vietnam, to examine competition in local water markets, and how piped water compares with a range of lower-quality traditional sources. Although previous studies have usefully employed contingent valuation to estimate the demand for low quality, the evidence provided here estimates demand based on actual household choices regarding water of differing qualities and prices. Using an original household survey, the paper assesses the comparative advantages regarding costs, uses, and perceived advantages/challenges of each source. Findings suggest that household demand for piped water exists, but not on a sufficient scale to obviate more traditional sources, even though it is surprisingly affordable when compared to what residents pay for natural sources. Findings also suggest that the main perceived advantage of the piped system is not for its hygienic quality, but for aesthetic characteristics such as taste, smell, and color. Scholars might continue to pursue research in situations where households are not limited in their ability to choose water sources of varying qualities.},

  abstract = {There are many places in the world where theorizing about planning barely finds fertile ground to grow. Institutional planning, promoted by nepotistic political representatives, is rarely counteracted by bottom-up practices closer to people's needs and dreams. Moreover, the few community organizations and grassroots associations that do exist often find it difficult to increase social consensus, affect decision making, and improve people's lives. In Sicily, Italy, the problems are compounded by the centuries-long history of mafia territorial dominance. Can planning help in such contexts? Can it, in particular, help in weakening the mafia's social consensus and ability to influence every component of society (economics, politics, culture)? If so, what kind of planning is needed? And who should implement it? This paper addresses these questions, telling the story of one ``difficult'' place\textemdash{}the area of the historical market of Catania (eastern Sicily), where a participatory action-research experience was carried out by the LabPEAT, University of Catania. The paper ends with an optimistic thought: participatory action-research\textemdash{}an approach to action in which a reflective rationality helps practitioners and communities to overcome dilemmas along the way, and to conceive of actions that go beyond the habitual\textemdash{}has shown potential to inform institutional and community planning choices in a way that counteracts Mafia hegemony.},

This paper analyzes streamflow trends in 187 sub-basins in the Iberian Peninsula for the period 1945\textendash{}2005. A database of monthly river discharges for the entire Iberian Peninsula including natural and regulated river regimes enabled assessment of the magnitude and spatial patterns and mechanisms of the hydrological trends. Annual and seasonal trend analyses were conducted. The results showed a marked decrease in annual, winter, and spring streamflows in most of the Iberian sub-basins, especially those in the south. In addition, changes in the seasonality of river regimes have occurred, most of them as consequence of dam regulation and water management strategies. We showed how river regulation by dams does not affect the sign of the trends, but its magnitude, by decreasing the releases during winter to meet the demand of water in summer creating important seasonal differences. The decrease of streamflows during the second half of the Twentieth Century in the Iberian Peninsula may accelerate in coming decades, as future climate projections show a generalized decrease in precipitation and more evapotranspiration induced by higher temperatures.},

Such maps can be preferable to choropleth maps that show data by enumeration zones, because dasymetric zones more accurately represent underlying data distributions. Though dasymetric mapping has existed for well over a century, the methods for producing these maps have not been thoroughly examined. In contrast, research on areal interpolation has been more thorough and has examined methods of transferring data from one set of map zones to another, an issue that is applicable to dasymetric mapping. Inspired by this work, we tested five dasymetric mapping methods, including methods derived from work on areal interpolation. Dasymetric maps of six socio-economic variables were produced fm a study area of 159 counties in the eastern U.S. using county choropleth data and ancillary land-use data. Both polygonal (vector) and grid (raster) dasymetric methods were tested. We evaluated map accuracy using both statistical analyses and visual presentations of error. A repeated-measures analysis of variance showed that the traditional limiting variable method had significantly lower error than the other four methods. In addition, polygon methods had lower error than their grid-based counterparts, though the difference was not statistically significant. Error maps largely supported the conclusions from the statistical analysis, while also presenting patterns of error that were not obvious from the statistics.},

This paper challenges that assertion, arguing that a person's tendency to participate in neighbourhood interventions is intimately related to their lifestyle as well. Analysing the results of a survey conducted in a Dutch city, we compare and contrast the personal circumstances and the mental attitudes of participants and non-participants. The results show that participants tend to evaluate participation more positively and in more altruistic terms than those who do not get involved. Participants are not necessarily older or poorer than non-participants, but tend to have lived in their neighbourhoods for longer and to have a greater sense of belonging to their local community. This suggests that collaborative planning has a structural bias towards inclusion of some parts of the community over others, excluding those whose social lives are not concentrated within the boundaries of the neighbourhood. Consequently, some of the perceived positive outcomes of collaborative processes are under pressure in the field of urban regeneration.},

This paper identifies the underlying causes of bad neighbourhoods along with their costs to local residents and residents throughout the region. It is a critical essay that traces recent patterns of uneven metropolitan development, the social forces generating these patterns, their many costs and potential remedies. It demonstrates how the interrelated processes of sprawl, concentration of poverty and racial segregation shape the opportunity structure facing diverse segments of the nation's urban and metropolitan population. In so doing, it draws on recent scholarly literature from various disciplines, government data and documents, research institute reports and the mass media. Topics addressed include income and wealth disparities, employment opportunities, housing patterns, access to health care and exposure to crime. While recognising the role of individual choice and human capital, the paper focuses on public policy decisions and related private-sector activities in determining how place and race shape the opportunity structure of metropolitan areas. Finally, the paper explores various policy options to sever the linkages among place, race and privilege in the nation's urban communities.},

Particular emphasis is placed on the planners' interaction with the public. The discussion analyses one city's planning system as it implements an ambitious ``governance outreach programme'' which involves interacting with youths who are using public space illegally. The central argument of the paper is that it is difficult to operationalise participatory governance in planning mainly because the relational nature of governance requires planners to act in ways that conflict with their preferred role as technical experts. The discussion exposes how pointless it can be for bureaucrats to interact with the public, when the participants' attitude, means, behaviour and style express no confidence in the institutional framework. The paper suggests that the transformation from government to governance is not merely procedural, and requires a deep cultural change on the part of planners.},

Many core African American societies have been devastated by the state, capital, and cultural policies of the last two decades. Simultaneously, geography and the other social sciences have been mobilized in order to prevent a fuller understanding of these communities and of the need for social equity. The further development of several approaches is required to open geography and the other disciplines up for community-building, rather than community destruction. The incorporation of research in the following areas holds out the promise of revitalizing both: human rights; the ethnic movements underlying restructuring; the social construction of regions; the reproduction of social power; building ethnic alliance; and indigenous knowledge systems.},

  abstract = {This article stems from the discrepancy between the lack of attention paid to industrial land policy by academics and the predominant thought among elected representatives and development agencies, i.e. that industrial land policy plays a key role in the creation of growth and new jobs. The article begins with a reflection on the literature, which stresses the need to develop knowledge on industrial land policies. To help fill this research gap, we have developed an exploratory piece of research on the theme of their `spatial' and `economic effectiveness', on the basis of statistical analyses dedicated to seven countries. As regards `spatial effectiveness', the results underline significant national differentials in terms of land consumption on the one hand, while highlighting the economic sprawl that affects France and Belgium on the other hand. As regards `economic effectiveness', our results show that the impact of the development of economic estates on growth depends largely on regional contexts. In particular, the `intermediate regions' in western Germany stand out as belonging to a specific context where land policies seem particularly effective from an economic standpoint. By contrast, the `economic effectiveness' of industrial land policies requires readjustments in the Netherlands as well as in most `predominantly rural regions, close to a city'.},

Recent developments in supranational and national planning policies, processes of devolution and changes in the British governance framework provide the foundation for the research element of the article. The research itself consists of a review of the spatial content of a series of sectoral policy documents published by the National Assembly for Wales. In addressing the character and extent of spatial references across different policy sectors, emphasis is placed on the potential for spatial planning instruments to facilitate `joined-up' policy and address complex issues of geographic distribution and spatial equity. The article concludes that a spatial planning approach, if successfully developed and enhanced, offers real value in the development of public policy.},

Based on a qualitative study, the article examines this concept in the city of Nazareth, which has been in turmoil since the introduction of a plan for a plaza. The article concludes that the reasons that may strongly contribute to the production of spaces of risk are: lack of the right to the city for urban inhabitants; the hegemony of the state over the city through `ethnocratic' urban policies; the hegemony of global forces and neo-liberal agendas over the locale; deficient local politics; absence of communicative planning procedures; and contradictions between planners conception of the place and the way inhabitants conceive and experience it in their daily life practices. As planning has the power of creating and triggering risks in cities, the article suggests some practical ways for planners to avoid the production of spaces of risk through new techniques of collaborative planning.},

  abstract = {Hiring-halls, specializing in the placement of day-laborers in temporary jobs, have in recent years been proliferating along major transport arteries in Chicago's low-income neighborhoods. This article examines the phenomenon of low-wage temporary work in Chicago from the perspective of the principal institutional actors in these highly `flexibilized' or `contingent' labor markets \textendash{} the `temp' agencies. Particular emphasis is placed on the labor-market effects of temp-agency strategies, both in respect to patterns of labor segmentation and in terms of the spatial (re)constitution of urban job markets. It is suggested that temp agencies are actively engaged in both the exploitation and facilitation of contingent labor-market conditions. In this sense, they are assuming important new roles as privatized `labor-market intermediaries', with apparently deleterious effects for job security and social segregation in the lower reaches of urban labor markets. Their strategies can also be related to the social and geographic restructuring of these job markets, because the growth and polarization of temp employment has been associated with a `hardening'\textendash{} and indeed `stretching'\textendash{} of extant ethnic, gender and spatial inequalities.Des bureaux d'embauche, sp{\'e}cialis{\'e}s dans le placement de journaliers sur des postes temporaires, ont r{\'e}cemment prolif{\'e}r{\'e} le long des grands axes de transport dans les quartiers d{\'e}favoris{\'e}s de Chicago. Cet article {\'e}tudie le ph{\'e}nom{\`e}ne du travail temporaire {\`a} faible revenu dans cette ville, et ce, du point de vue des principaux acteurs institutionnels sur ces march{\'e}s du travail hautement `flexibilis{\'e}s' ou `al{\'e}atoires': les agences de travail temporaire. Il insiste sur les cons{\'e}quences des strat{\'e}gies de ces agences pour le march{\'e} de l'emploi, {\`a} la fois au niveau des sch{\'e}mas de segmentation du travail et en termes de (re)constitution spatiale des march{\'e}s du travail urbains. Aussi peut-on sugg{\'e}rer que ces agences sont activement impliqu{\'e}es dans l'exploitation et la facilitation des conditions al{\'e}atoires du march{\'e} du travail. En ce sens, elles jouent un r{\^o}le important et nouveau comme `interm{\'e}diaires du march{\'e} du travail' privatis{\'e}s, avec des effets apparemment n{\'e}fastes pour la s{\'e}curit{\'e} de l'emploi et la s{\'e}gr{\'e}gation sociale dans les circuits inf{\'e}rieurs des march{\'e}s urbains. Leurs strat{\'e}gies peuvent aussi {\^e}tre li{\'e}es {\`a} la restructuration sociale et g{\'e}ographique de ces march{\'e}s, la croissance et la polarisation de l'emploi temporaire ayant {\`e}t{\`e} associ{\'e}es {\`a} un `durcissement', et assur{\'e}ment {\`a} une `extension', des in{\'e}galit{\'e}s existantes au plan ethnique, spatial et des sexes.},

These changes led to the development of urban housing markets and a housing finance system. The bibliography then examines influences from legislative and administrative sectors, such as land use laws, governmental policies, and urban planning. In addition, the bibliography examines Hong Kong's land use system that is based on market mechanisms in which, nonetheless, the city government, through land use laws and plans, plays a significant role.},

A close look at its built environment demonstrates significant outcomes in terms of building and landscape design, overall neighborhood planning, and accompanying demographic changes. Existing work on Southwest and its postwar peers duly illustrates the racial injustice and physical and social loss that urban renewal produced. This article expands and supplements these narratives with parallel stories of enduring residential structures amid commercial failures, and new community formation where another had been torn apart. The result is a mixed physical and social legacy for urban renewal that has attracted both criticism and commemoration.},

A well-developed literature on hiring low-skilled workers has much to say about why such zones have resulted in little employment for nearby residents of distressed areas but has not informed evaluation or policy for zones. Using the Detroit Empowerment Zone experience as a case, this article finds that referrals, usually from employees, determined hiring, resulting in industrial districts with few local workers and retail districts with many more, with workplaces segregated by race and ethnicity. Although skill requirements and screening approaches should not have excluded many qualified local workers, employers in industrial areas had negative stereotypes of workers from nearby neighborhoods. Trusted intermediaries such as community-based organizations may enable tax incentive zones to produce jobs for local workers by breaking down stereotypes and inserting a new ``mouth'' in the word-of-mouth hiring practices.},

  abstract = {The legitimization of planning has, in the period since the Second World War, rested on the proposition that the state's intervention in land and property development is necessary to safeguard the public interest against private and sectional interests. What constitutes the public interest has always been contentious but its value as a legitimizing concept has increasingly been called into question in the recent past for the reason that it cannot be given operational meaning either by those who make policy or by those who evaluate it. The purpose of this article is to explore the `public interest' justification of planning and whether it has outlived its usefulness in an increasingly fragmented society. Following an introduction, the argument is presented in three stages. First, we explore the concept of `interests' in the modern period. Second, we consider the way in which the `public interest' has been regarded in the planning literature. Third, an evaluative framework is established which distinguishes deontological as well as consequentialist conceptualizations of the public interest through which we seek to demonstrate that it remains the pivot around which debates concerning the role and purpose of planning must revolve.},

  abstract = {Experts with different land use interests often use differing definitions of land suitability that can result in competing land use decisions. We use Bayesian belief networks linked to GIS data layers to integrate empirical data and expert knowledge from two different land use interests (development and conservation) in Maine's Lower Penobscot River Watershed. Using ground locations and digital orthoquads, we determined the overall accuracy of the resulting development and conservation suitability maps to be 82\% and 89\%, respectively. Overlay of the two maps show large areas of land suitable for both conservation protection and economic development and provide multiple options for mitigating potential conflict among these competing land users. The modeling process can be adapted to help prioritize and choose among different alternatives as new information becomes available, or as land use and land-use policies change. The current model structure provides a maximal coverage strategy that allows decision makers to target and prioritize several areas for protection or development and to set specific strategies in the face of changing ecological, social, or economic processes. Having multiple options can generate new hypotheses and decisions at more local scales or for more specific conservation purposes not yet identified by stakeholders and decision makers in the region. Subsequently, new models can be developed using the same process, but with higher resolution data, thereby helping a community evaluate the impacts of alternative land uses between different prioritized areas at finer scales.},

The politics of planning was not only about what should be done on the site, but also about the sort of procedure that should be followed to take a legitimate decision. The paper conceives of the political process as a sequence of staged performances and introduces a model that analyses policy processes in terms of discourse, dramaturgy and deliberation. It describes the rebuilding of Ground Zero as a case of an `unhappy performance' in which, as the process continued, the wider publicly-shared determination to create a bold symbolic response to terrorism lost out to uninspired political-economic reasoning. It argues that this analysis of policy processes as performance deserves a much wider application as today's world is full of situations in which decisions are made in networks marked by unclear rules as to how to arrive at a legitimate decision.},

More research is needed on adaptive capacity and effectiveness for non-regulatory approaches to environmental management.

Based on a case study in Hayy el-Sellom (Beirut), the article traces the changing practices that ensued from the integration of this informal settlement's housing market in the affordable housing market of the city's suburbs by looking at how exchanges were secured and redress sought in cases of default. Research findings indicate that the introduction of practices borrowed from the larger housing market did not improve market securities.

  abstract = {Hazard mitigation plans (HMPs) play a critical role in the reduction of societal loss from natural and human-caused hazards and disasters. The occurrence of hazardous events cannot be prevented but hazard mitigation planning when diligently applied has proven to be an effective tool for enhancing local community resilience and reducing societal losses. HMPs are planning documents that aim to increase community preparedness and resiliency, and decrease vulnerability in the event of a hazard. However, due to a variety of reasons many communities often fail to address criteria that could protect against future societal losses. For instance, minimum requirements, as stipulated by the Disaster Mitigation Act 2000, are all that is needed to qualify for federal mitigation grant funding regardless of plan quality or appropriateness of HMPs to local hazards and risks. Additionally local emergency managers and planners also face constraints like integration of HMPs into comprehensive plans and a standardized tool to evaluate plan quality. In essence most communities in the US have HMPs but lack a method of evaluating the quality and effectiveness of their plans for mitigating hazards. Building on the standard HMP minimum requirements, additional criteria established in prominent hazard literature, and information culled from interviews, this study develops an evaluation matrix to assess local HMP quality. Based on the factors mentioned above, researchers explored the opportunities and constraints to HMP development faced by jurisdictions within our Western Washington study area. Conclusions reveal that available resources, level of sophistication, and political complexities affect the quality of HMP development and the actual implementation of mitigation planning strategies.},

Two key issues of biotope mapping are highlighted: how to increase the chances of people having contact with urban biodiversity based on biotope mapping, and how to develop an effective method of biotope mapping in order to obtain much more urban biodiversity information. It is found that comprehensive surveys of all land parcels are important in urban biotope mapping, and especially investigation of small-scale biotopes close to people's living places that still have potential biodiversity value. Many studies show that there is a close relation between vegetation structure and biodiversity. A modified biotope classification method integrated with structural variables is proposed for biotope mapping as a basis for urban biodiversity development.},

It draws on sociological research into consumption to interrogate the various logics that underlie the concept of ``customer-focused'' planning services, and shows that they are typically based on an oversimplification of the relationships involved in both producing and consuming planning services. In particular, analyses of these reforms tend to underplay the demands that are made of consumers of planning services. The new analytic framework that is presented is illustrated with a case study that investigates the experience of small businesses when applying for planning permission.},

Evidence-based practice proposes a better connection between research and professional work, but raises several concerns about the character of valid evidence, the strength and clarity of planning research, and inequalities in the available resources for integrating research into planning practice. Much of planning practice is a reflective craft where skills of mediation, negotiation, listening, and framing are prominent. As part of the planner's work employing these skills, however, there is a valuable role for research-generated evidence to inform decision making. Evidence-based practice needs careful implementation but it can enrich the field of planning by linking research to practice.},

In this research, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), we explore whether U.S. government-owned land already devoted to nuclear uses would provide logical locations for new nuclear activities. We surveyed people living within 50 miles of six existing DOE nuclear weapons sites, asking about their attitudes toward banning additional nuclear activities at these sites and about factors that might influence these attitudes. Although the majority said prohibiting additional nuclear uses at these sites was a high priority, many were willing to entertain the idea. This work suggests ways to make nuclear siting more successful by considering pre-existing sites, and encouraging the DOE to try harder to open communication channels with the public and its representatives.},

We found that the implementation of land use plans was generally low and varied greatly among plans and issues. Although it was tested in the context of local plans in New Zealand, the methodology can be used by city and county planning agencies in the U.S. and elsewhere.},

  abstract = {Traditional stated choice (SC) experiments are the most widely used method for measuring individual preferences. Notwithstanding, the issue of differentiating between the impacts of the attributes per se vs. the impact of the attribute levels shown in the experiment has been something of a challenge for researchers. Recent studies suggest that Best-Worst scaling (B-W) experiments would allow for the possibility of making this discrimination. In this study we combine B-W data with more traditional SC data to model the choice of residential location; we also allow for observed and unobserved heterogeneity in the combined models. To the best of our knowledge, this type of data fusion has not been used before in this context. Our dataset is fairly unique and corresponds to a sample of individuals interested in acquiring a flat in the centre of Santiago, Chile, from whom both types of responses were elicited. In addition, we have available a larger independent validation sample that responded to a second SC exercise in the same location and time period. We found that the best-fit model corresponded to pooling the 'best' and SC responses (i.e., ignoring the 'worst' data), while accounting for systematic taste variations (observable heterogeneity) and allowing for a correct treatment of the pseudo-panel nature of the data through error components (unobserved heterogeneity). Our results imply that analysts could get valuable additional information to increase their understanding on individuals' behaviour when considering the joint use of B-W Scaling and SC data incorporating heterogeneity.

The paper shows the construction of the modern paradigm of scientific town planning and identifies the planning theory and practice of the Portuguese capital as a product and a model of French urbanisme, integrated in an international ideological movement. Using Lisbon as a case study, it identifies three key periods, each speaking to different ideological concerns. An initial expansionist period began at the end of the nineteenth century, characterized by hygienist concerns, park creation, and early attempts at regulation. It was followed by a second scientific and legalist era, whose functionalist ideals, search for order, and meticulous obsession with regulation, were very much in tune with the totalitarian military dictatorship of Salazar, the authoritarian ruler of Portugal between 1932 and 1968. Finally, the democratization of society saw the advent of new flexibility in political power, and a corresponding turn amongst planners away from scientific rationalism towards public participation and urban regeneration concerns.},

  abstract = {This study explores the reasons why the failure to site and implement waste disposal facilities in the United States and Canada has become commonplace, using the example of waste environmental impact assessment (EIA) programs in Ontario, Canada. The inability of governments to site new waste disposal facilities can be traced to a slavish adherence to planning's most common paradigm, the rational comprehensive model. The article also addresses whether the extensive public consultation programs associated with waste EIAs are effective. The study concludes with a discussion of how the communicative action of planning should be researched in waste management to develop more efficient and less socially divisive planning programs.},

On the Israeli side, we find that terrorism has contributed to an existing momentum of decentralization and accelerated a declining city center. On the Palestinian side, the construction of the Jerusalem barrier has changed the shape of the metropolitan area, separating neighborhoods from one another and some from the rest of the city. Together, terror and barriers are changing the topography of metropolitan Jerusalem.},

In the face of these developments, the Chicago Plan Commission radically redefined its street plans to accommodate automobiles, often in contrast to the Plan's proposals\textemdash{}prompting protest from Edward Bennett and others. As a result, the Commission fired Bennett in 1929, signaling the Commission's turn away from the Plan's vision and toward a new view of the role of the street in the city.},

They argue that compact housing and urban patterns reduce both household and transportation energy use and should be promoted to combat a variety of ills, including import dependency and climate change. However, planners also have a strong role to play in energy production, particularly with the increasing adoption of renewable forms of energy. Planners will play an integral part in harmonizing local land use regulations and policies that will either promote or hinder the adoption of these technologies. In this article, we review industry and government reports, regulations, professional standards, news articles, and peer-reviewed literature in disparate fields. We identify pertinent environmental and land use planning issues of different types of centralized, distributed, conventional, and renewable energy generation, the implications and externalities of their fuel extraction, transportation, transmission and distribution, siting of generation facilities as well as the disposal of the waste. While the literature is voluminous, these issues have received scant attention in the planning literature. We make the case that land use and environmental planners should have a strong interest in energy.},

We further measure economic growth by the concentration of high-growth firms and employ descriptive statistics and spatial regressions to analyze the correlations. We first find the presence of vibrant centers in both urban and suburban areas. More important, we observe that vibrant centers have captured more of these high-growth firms. These results suggest the need for more refined theoretical and empirical analysis of urban vibrancy, economic development, and place attractiveness at the intrametropolitan scale.},

Second, the state, at various levels, is fueling the process more directly than in the past. Third, anti-gentrification social movements have been marginalized within the urban political sphere. Finally, the land economics of inner-city investment have changed in ways that accelerate certain types of neighborhood change.},

  abstract = {America is the world leader in innovation, but many of the innovative ideas that are hatched in American start-ups, labs, and companies end up going abroad to reach commercial scale. Apple, the superstar of innovation, locates its production in China (yet still reaps most of its profits in the United States). When innovation does not find the capital, skills, and expertise it needs to come to market in the United States, what does it mean for economic growth and job creation? Inspired by the MIT Made in America project of the 1980s, Making in America brings experts from across MIT to focus on a critical problem for the country.MIT scientists, engineers, social scientists, and management experts visited more than 250 firms in the United States, Germany, and China. In companies across America--from big defense contractors to small machine shops and new technology startups--these experts tried to learn how we can rebuild the industrial landscape to sustain an innovative economy. At each stop, they asked this basic question: "When you have a new idea, how do you get it into the market?" They found gaping holes and missing pieces in the industrial ecosystem. Critical strengths and capabilities that once helped bring new enterprises to life have disappeared: production capacity; small and medium-size suppliers; spillovers of research, training, and new technology from big corporations. ( Production in the Innovation Economy, also published by the MIT Press in 2013, describes this research.)Even in an Internet-connected world, proximity to innovation and users matters for industry. Making in America describes ways to strengthen this connection, including public-private collaborations, new government-initiated manufacturing innovation institutes, and industry-community college projects. If we can learn from these ongoing experiments in linking innovation to production, American manufacturing could have a renaissance.},

Through an analysis of neighborhood mobilization around environmental projects in Boston, Barcelona, and Havana, I unravel common patterns of activism aimed at rebuilding community and remaking place, thereby addressing physical and psychological dimensions of environmental health.},

  abstract = {Abstract: The temporary staffing industry (TSI) in the United States has enjoyed explosive growth since the 1970s, during which time the market for temporary labor has become increasingly complex and diverse. Rather than focus, as has typically been done, on the wider labor market effects of this sustained expansion in temporary employment, this article explores patterns and processes of industrial restructuring in the TSI itself. The analysis reveals a powerfully recursive relationship among evolving TSI business practices, the industry's strategies for building and extending the market, and urban labor market outcomes as the sector has grown through a series of qualitatively differentiated phases of development or ``modes of growth.'' Moreover, the distinctive character of the TSI's geographic rollout raises a new set of questions concerning, inter alia, the links between temping and labor market deregulation, the nature of local competition, the scope for and limits of value-adding strategies, and the emerging global structure of the temp market. This idiosyncratic industry\textemdash{}which has been a conspicuous beneficiary of growing economic instability\textemdash{}has, throughout the past three decades, restructured continuously through a period of sustained but highly uneven growth. In so doing, it has proved to be remarkably inventive in extending the market for contingent labor, but has encountered a series of (possibly structural) obstacles to further expansion in its domestic market. These obstacles, in turn, have triggered an unprecedented phase of international integration in the TSI, along with a new mode of development\textemdash{}global growth.},

Despite differences in research focus and approach, scholars agree that quality is the outcome of a contingent and so far underresearched process of negotiation that entails and determines relations of power in the food chain. To understand the nature and implications of the relationship between quality and power in the food sector, this paper focuses on the recent `quality revolution' implemented in the school meals system in Rome. Based on the analysis of documentary material and qualitative data collected through formal and informal interviews, the paper examines the process through which city authorities have integrated different (and at times contrasting) quality conventions. The analysis shows that procurement policies such as those implemented in Rome have the power to create an `economy of quality' that can deliver the economic, environmental, and social benefits of sustainable development.},

A growing number of cities, states and regions in Europe, North America and elsewhere are designing development strategies around strategic clusters of industries. In many cases, a lack of data on local and interregional industrial linkages, shared business institutions, channels of technology and knowledge transfer, and other dimensions of the cluster concept means that relatively simple measures (location quotients, industry size) are often used to initially detect clusters in subnational regions. In this paper, we suggest a means of using available information on national interindustry linkages to identify potential clusters in subnational areas. Specifically, we derive a set of 23 US manufacturing clusters and employ them as templates in an illustrative analysis of the manufacturing sector in a single US state. The template clusters help detect gaps and specializations in extended product chains and therefore constitute a useful first step in more comprehensive examinations of local cluster patterns.

I describe 4 different propensity score methods: matching on the propensity score, stratification on the propensity score, inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score, and covariate adjustment using the propensity score. I describe balance diagnostics for examining whether the propensity score model has been adequately specified. Furthermore, I discuss differences between regression-based methods and propensity score-based methods for the analysis of observational data.

  abstract = {Attention to global and world cities has directed the field of urban studies to the significance of international and transnational processes in shaping city economies. This article evaluates these approaches, from a position off their maps. I argue that the circulation of these approaches in academic and policy realms adversely impacts on cities which do not fall into these categories by setting up the idea of the global city as a `regulating fiction', a standard towards which they aspire. It establishes a small sector of the global economy as most desirable in planning the future of cities. By contrast, mega\textendash{}cities function as the dramatic `other' of world and global cities, and highlight the developmentalist discourse through which most cities in poor countries are assessed as fundamentally lacking in qualities of city\textendash{}ness. I argue that the long\textendash{}standing categories of western/third\textendash{}world cities have been translated into the apparently transnational accounts of global and world cities. Western cities continue to be the primary site of production of apparently unlocated urban theory; so\textendash{}called third\textendash{}world cities (and other cities off the map of the world cities cartography) are interpreted through a developmentalist lens and, where they are referred to at all, are framed in terms of `difference' or irrelevance. This article draws attention to the emergence of an alternative set of theoretical approaches, which are more inclusive in their geographical reach and which are concerned with the diverse dynamics of ordinary cities. These approaches have not yet realized that they have the potential to broaden the base for theorizing about cities and, with this in mind, the article explores the potential for a more cosmopolitan urban theory. The policy stakes in this are high, and the article notes that there are important political reasons to promote the analysis of ordinary cities in the face of the persistence of ambitions in many cities to become `world cities`.L'attention accord{\'e}e aux villes plan{\'e}taires et mondiales a orient{\'e} le champ des {\'e}tudes urbaines vers l'importance des processus internationaux et transnationaux dans la configuration {\'e}conomique des villes. Partant d'un point situ{\'e} hors de leur cartographie, l'article {\'e}value ces approches. La circulation de celles\textendash{}ci dans les sph{\`e}res politiques et intellectuelles a une incidence n{\'e}faste sur les villes qui n'appartiennent pas {\`a} ces cat{\'e}gories, car elle instaure l'id{\'e}e d'une ville plan{\'e}taire en tant que `fiction r{\'e}gulatrice', norme {\`a} laquelle aspirent les villes. Un secteur restreint de l'{\'e}conomie mondiale est ainsi {\'e}tabli comme le plus recherch{\'e} dans la planification urbaine. Par contraste, les megacities fonctionnent comme l'impressionnant `autre' des villes mondiales et plan{\'e}taires, valorisant le discours d{\'e}veloppementaliste selon lequel l'{\'e}valuation des villes des pays pauvres indique le plus souvent des lacunes fondamentales dans les qualit{\'e}s propres {\`a} une ville. Les anciennes cat{\'e}gories de villes (Occident/tiers\textendash{}monde) ont {\'e}t{\'e} converties en justifications apparemment transnationales des villes plan{\'e}taires et mondiales.

  abstract = {This study uses urban regime theory to understand the events surrounding Fargo urban renewal during the 1950s. Specifically, it focuses upon the struggle between realtors, banking officers, government officials, and other local actors, as they established a plan for relocating Fargo residents displaced by urban renewal. With a downtown Civic Center as their ultimate goal, coalition partners set aside their differences and produced an unprecedented plan: to avoid any reliance on public housing, relocation would be handled via the private sector, specifically the Fargo Board of Realtors. The study demonstrates that this relocation plan and its subsequent revisions reflected the interests of the individual regime members.},

This article identifies the historical, economic, and political factors that link precarious employment to health and health equity; reviews concepts, models, instruments, and findings on precarious employment and health inequalities; summarizes the strengths and weaknesses of this literature; and highlights substantive and methodological challenges that need to be addressed. We identify two crucial future aims: to provide a compelling research program that expands our understanding of employment precariousness and to develop and evaluate policy programs that effectively put an end to its health-related impacts.},

The author proposes the incremental integration of the two worldviews through an overall strategy of action and the use of a decision model that incorporates project and context information to identify appropriate method and role. As the ecological worldview becomes more institutionalized, it is likely that its components will be increasingly reflected in community development strategies.},

Planning codes and urban policy tools can be improved through the preliminary control of typological and morphological requirements.

  abstract = {From Cotton Belt to Sunbelt investigates the effects of federal policy on the American South from 1938 until 1980 and charts the close relationship between federal efforts to reform the South and the evolution of activist government in the modern United States. Decrying the South's economic backwardness and political conservatism, the Roosevelt Administration launched a series of programs to reorder the Southern economy in the 1930s. After 1950, however, the social welfare state had been replaced by the national security state as the South's principal benefactor. Bruce J. Schulman contrasts the diminished role of national welfare initiatives in the postwar South with the expansion of military and defense-related programs. He analyzes the contributions of these growth-oriented programs to the South's remarkable economic expansion, to the development of American liberalism, and to the excruciating limits of Sunbelt prosperity, ultimately relating these developments to southern politics and race relations. By linking the history of the South with the history of national public policy, Schulman unites two issues that dominate the domestic history of postwar America\textemdash{}the emergence of the Sunbelt and the expansion of federal power over the nation's economic and social life. A forcefully argued work, From Cotton Belt to Sunbelt, originally published in 1991(Oxford University Press), will be an important guide to students and scholars of federal policy and modern Southern history.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.ssresearch.2005.11.005},
  abstract = {Dual labor market theory asserts that the American labor market is sharply divided between good jobs and bad jobs, and that mobility between these two segments of the market is severely restricted. The new labor market segmentation thesis argues that, as the practice of allocating workers to inferior jobs on the basis of race and sex has declined, employers have turned to nonstandard work arrangements and immigrants to supply labor for low-wage jobs. This paper presents a new method for measuring labor market dualism and identifying discrete labor market segments. This method allows us to examine the distribution of workers across these segments over the life course and to estimate the effects of nonstandard work and citizenship status on creating and placing workers into bad jobs. Three major findings are evident from this research. First, since the early 1970s the level dualism in the American labor market has increased substantially. Second, most workers who begin their careers in the secondary (bad) jobs eventually leave this labor market for better jobs, After young adulthood, most of the workforce is roughly divided between primary (good) intermediary (mediocre) jobs. Finally, results from the multivariate analysis support the new segmentation hypothesis. Combined, nonstandard work and citizenship now play a greater direct role in allocating workers to secondary and intermediary jobs than race or sex.},

Two long and complexly designed parkways were built, Eastern Parkway and Ocean Parkway, and special platting was laid out for an envisioned neighborhood, but little development occurred around the parkways for forty years. This article looks at the evolution of built form around the parkways from before they were constructed until the present day, analyzing the development that actually occurred in relation to the original planning vision.},

To investigate these differing perceptions, we queried residents of conventional and conservation subdivisions in the same township regarding their nearby natural environment and other aspects of their residential context. While study participants considered `nature view from home' a top priority, the content of these views differed substantially. The most preferred views, of wooded areas, were relatively unavailable in the conventional communities. Yet these subdivisions might more accurately be experienced as `open.' The results of our study thus point to the potential for misunderstandings about `open space' preservation.

This study seeks to identify whether they successfully provide for two-way communication between agencies and the public, and to explore potential differences between CABs sponsored by military and civilian agencies. The analysis is based on a general model of information and feedback flows and consists of five comparative case studies of CABs sponsored by the EPA, DOD, and DOE. It focuses on communicative processes recorded in meeting minutes, interviews with participants, and surveys of nonparticipants. The study shows that CABs do not necessarily provide effective deliberative mechanisms: participation is limited by the lack of public awareness of participatory opportunities, CABs emphasize one-way agency-to-CAB communication, and public input does not significantly influence agency decisions. The military culture of secrecy appears to hinder participation at some sites, although the case-study approach and differences between boards do not allow broad generalizations about interagency differences.},

We then look at mismatch along not only spatial lines but racial lines as well, by estimating the effects of job density measures that are disaggregated by race. We find that it is primarily black job density that influences black male employment, whereas white job density has little if any influence on their employment.

This research explored the feasibility of recycling organic solid waste into urban cultivation as a sustainable waste-management strategy in low-income neighborhoods. The main hypothesis of this study is that a significant proportion of solid waste can be diverted from inefficient disposal by redirecting the organic fraction into urban cultivation. The study revealed that waste-based urban cultivation could significantly reduce quantities of organic solid waste for disposal, and minimize waste collection and disposal cost. Challenges to implementing the concept include overcoming the issue of land availability and motivating stakeholders to initiate, implement, and sustain such projects.},

  abstract = {The concept of the `million dollar block' refers to the spatially concentrated urban origins of the US prison population, most of whom come from a handful of neighborhoods in the country's biggest cities. Visualized through a series of maps charting home addresses alongside financial costs of imprisonment, the million dollar block has emerged as a powerful rhetorical umbrella for bipartisan collaboration on prison reform. This article critically tracks the way the million dollar block, as both a cartography and a discursive formation, has travelled politically over the past decade. Finding parallels with the `neighborhood effects' discourse within urban studies, I suggest the million dollar block similarly functions to cast poor and racialized urban spaces primarily in terms of criminogenic risk. I describe how the discursive cartography of the million dollar block, despite its reformist intentions, serves a neoliberal model of prison reform, rationalizing increased carceral state intervention in urban space.},

Green developments will reach their potential only if residents understand the design, support the goals, and act as responsible land managers. However, studies by psychologists, anthropologists, environmental educators, and economists show that even knowledgeable, well-intentioned people frequently fail to adopt proenvironmental behaviors. This article identifies three categories of potential barriers to better individual land management: barriers to recognizing environmental problems, internal barriers to action, and external barriers to action. Two case studies show that unless barriers are addressed through education or design, individuals probably will not adopt more ecologically sensitive practices. Both cases are in the tallgrass prairie ecoregion.},

Planning systems and planners have not been immune from this growing sense of mistrust which not only has implications for planners as professionals, but also for planning as an activity. This article explores the consequences of the ``crisis of trust'' for planning and planners. In doing so, it sets out to understand why this crisis has arisen, and identifies four main theses (the rise of the risk society, the rise of the pluralistic society, the rise of the rights-based society and the rise of advanced liberalism). Each thesis is discussed in relation to general changes in society and the implications for planning and planners. It is concluded that whilst narrow views of trust may help us focus on individual and community relationships, a wider notion of trust may be valuable for its focus on values and common goals. Furthermore, problems of the rise of auditing and systems of control especially within the context of advanced liberalism and the rise of the pluralistic society are identified as having particular purchase on both the decline of trust in planning and how we might seek to restore trust.},

Five primary results emerge: (1) urban form helps predict travel mode to and from school; (2) middle school students walk further than planners expect; (3) many students use a different mode when they travel to school and when they leave school; (4) urban form measures that predict walking behavior differ from those that predict biking behavior; and (5) urban form is only one factor in students' transportation decisions.},

This study, alternatively, reveals these formations as adroitly proactive and interactively heterogeneous across their respective cities. Through a racial economy lens, we empirically examine the racial contours of this ``governance heterogeneity'' in one urban setting: Chicago, Illinois. In this frame, a comparative analysis of Chicago's Bronzeville and Pilsen neighborhoods is presented. Both neighborhoods are constituted by different racial profiles: Bronzeville is home to a predominantly African-American population, whereas Pilsen is mostly Mexican and Mexican-American. The study reveals that redevelopment governances are differentially responsive to established, deeply rooted racialized conceptions of ``Blackness'' and ``Latinoness.'' As a result, the form and trajectory of redevelopment in both settings has unfolded in markedly different ways.},

The main student-level data samples come from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) and the associated Postsecondary Education Transcript Study (PETS:2000). I estimate a multinomial logit of college choice and find that students self-select into for-profit colleges and that the choice of for-profit college is affected by community college tuition. The probability of a student choosing a for-profit college is also heavily influenced by the student's socioeconomic background and parental involvement in the student's schooling. The students with higher school absenteeism are more likely to enroll into for-profit college. Finally, the concentration of for-profit colleges in the student's county is important for the choice of for-profit college.},

Landscape continuity strategies are often situated as a response either to urban sprawl, or to the need to protect ecological features and functions over vast, connected terrains and multiple jurisdictions. While the concept is rooted in the natural and physical science of landscape ecology, its interpretation and deployment in environmental planning often hinges on the landscape ideals and preferences of those active in planning processes. This research employs discourse analysis to examine the interpretation of landscape continuity along the fringes of Toronto, Canada, and finds a strong current of social injustice flowing through efforts to preserve nature and ``legacy landscapes.''

In European spatial development, a zone-based framework that builds on connecting infrastructure (often referred to as a development corridor in an international context) has been discussed as a tool to promote both competitive and balanced development and to more efficiently utilise the existing infrastructure. Furthermore, in Finnish policy rhetoric, RDZs are seen as potential tools in developing simultaneously economically, socially and environmentally sustainable spatial structure. In the practices of regional development, however, these comprehensive goals are so far more aspirational than practised reality. There is a disconnection between the standard physical planning and new ``soft'' development framework, a disconnection between national and regional objectives, a lack of nationally coordinated policies, and a lagging completion of the institutional framework for comprehensive spatial development.},

  abstract = {Problem: A redevelopment aim of numerous Western world cities is to attract creative firms to formerly abandoned or neglected districts. While some studies propose that visual assets of neighborhoods may attract creative entrepreneurs to certain districts, few have explored how visual features are important for creative entrepreneurs and provided meaningful planning knowledge. Purpose: This article examines the influence of district visual form as perceived by creative entrepreneurs on their location decisions. It suggests how this knowledge is usable for development of cultural production districts. Methods: I conducted 63 interviews with creative entrepreneurs in three districts in The Netherlands: the Eastern Docklands in Amsterdam, the Lloyd Quarter in Rotterdam, and the Hortus Quarter in Groningen. These districts accommodate relatively more firms in creative industries than do other districts within the same cities, but they are visually disparate in terms of architecture and urban spaces. Results and conclusions: This article demonstrates a significant relationship between district visual quality and the location behavior of creative entrepreneurs. Moreover, there is more than one visual model for cultural production districts. Urban design, architecture, waterfronts, and parks may have various forms, provided that they single out one place from other, mainstream places. The overall visual character of the district needs to be perceived as distinctive, whether deliberately designed as such or not. Because the visual quality of the district contributes to increased creative productivity, creative entrepreneurs use their relative freedom of location within cities to achieve quality of place at work. Takeaway for practice: Cities that aim to attract creative entrepreneurs to certain districts should use strategies to achieve district visual quality. I draw on my findings to point at several planning strategies to inspire flexible, localized approaches to the development of visually distinctive cultural production districts. These strategies can be alternated and adjusted over time, according to a district's existing visual quality, availability of government resources, and the changing constraints and opportunities of a region's cultural production system. Research support: Dissertation support from Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands. Dissertation Fellowship from the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, Cambridge, MA, USA. The Netherlands Institute of City Innovation Studies (NICIS), The Hague, and the municipalities of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Groningen cofinanced the fieldwork.},

I analyze the SBA's conceptualization of minority, lending goals, outreach methods, and its reliance on banks to promote its loan program, revealing how these practices build upon and reinforce existing inequalities among people of color. Data suggests flexible approaches to minority business development by the SBA may ultimately be unhelpful for African Americans but useful for non-black people of color. The study concludes with the policy recommendation that the SBA create a direct loan program that explicitly promotes black business, with consideration given to the difficulties of having such a proposal adopted.},

Once public investments in an area reach some minimum threshold, do they leverage substantial private resources? To address these questions, we examine a coordinated, sustained, and targeted revitalization strategy begun in 1998 in Richmond, VA. The strategy was developed through a data-driven, participatory planning process that garnered widespread support. Our analyses reveal that the program produced substantially greater appreciation in the market values of single-family homes in the targeted areas than in comparable homes in similarly distressed neighborhoods. The greatest impacts occurred when public investments over 5 years exceeded \$21,000 per block, on average. This appears to make the strategy potentially self-financing over a 20-year horizon, with public contributions offset by future increments in property tax revenues from target areas.},

Yet this question has not been addressed in years or with many observations. This paper uses novel data sets including 167 elections and 108 black mayors to examine their impact on fiscal and employment policies. Empirically, it uses multiple approaches including regression discontinuity design.  In most observable policy areas, the inauguration of a black mayor leads to policies that are indistinguishable from cities where black mayors do not govern. Police hiring represents an exception, with black mayors hiring more black officers. These results suggest a disconnect between the racially polarized elections that produce black mayors and the governance that follows. They raise concerns about the potential of city elections to induce accountability, and they reinforce the centrality of criminal justice as an urban political issue.},

In Hong Kong, where the role of land use in mode choice is obvious due to the densely built environment, the focus was on whether land use completely explained the transit-dominated travel pattern. The empirical modeling confirmed that the role of land use in influencing travel was independent from travel time and monetary costs. Elasticity estimates show that the composite effect of land use on driving could be comparable in magnitude to that of driving cost. Yet being place specific, land use strategies are limited by the spatial extent to which they can be implemented. Land use strategies influence travel more effectively when complemented by pricing policies.},

This review suggests bridging between three distinct research paths concerned with urban areas and nature: urban ecosystem services, urban metabolism and urban political ecology to forge new thinking to transition from the sanitary city of the twentieth century to the sustainable city of the twenty-first. Cities are anthropogenic creations, sourcing their materials from nearby and far-off places, transforming those materials into products, goods and the physical infrastructure of cities. Tracking that flow of nature into the built environment, and the other flows such as water, needs to be accounted for as part of nature in the city. Cities \textendash{} having entirely transformed the place they are located through building \textendash{} have a unique nature, a nature planted by people, and made up of plants and animals that are often different than what had existed in the first place. The services of this new assemblage of species in the city, need to be studied critically. But ultimately, cities are the product of human volition, driven by economics, culture, politics and history. Understanding those drivers \textendash{} the political ecology of place \textendash{} provides an interpretive framework for reconsidering the nature of cities and its place in moving from a modernist sanitary city to a gray/green sustainable city.},

The benefits humans and society can derive from biophysical processes cannot be viewed as objectively existing ``out there'', but as entangled in social and political processes. This is unpacked through the analytical moments of generation, distribution and articulation of ecosystem services. Social practice moderates the generation of benefits from biophysical processes (through urban development patterns and day-to-day management of urban ecosystems), but also who in society that benefits from them, i.e. the distribution of ecosystem services (viewed here as the temporal and spatial scales at which it is possible for humans to benefit from biophysical processes). Moreover, for biophysical processes to attain value in decision-making, a social practice of value articulation is needed. The framework then moves between two levels of analysis. At the city-wide level, an ecological network translates how urban `green' areas, viewed as nodes, are interconnected by ecological flows (water, species movement, etc.) where nodes have different protective and management capacities. The network captures spatial complexity\textemdash{}what happens in one location, can have effects elsewhere. At the local level, urban struggles over land-use are studied to trace how actors utilize artifacts and social arenas to articulate how certain biophysical processes are of value. Competing networks of value articulation strive to influence land-use, and multiple local studies bring understanding of how power operates locally, informing city-wide analyses. Empirical studies from Stockholm, Cape Town and other cities inform the framework.},

  abstract = {Over the past few years, a new 'geographical' economics has emerged, focused on the spatial agglomeration of industry and the long-run convergence of regional incomes. Several leading names are associated with this 'geographical turn', including Paul Krugman, Michael Porter, Robert Barro and W. Brian Arthur. This 'new economic geography', it is argued here, is neither that new, nor is it geography. Instead, it is a reworking (or re-invention) - using recent developments in formal (mathematical) mainstream economics - of traditional location theory and regional science. As such it is quite opposed to, and difficult to reconcile with, the work on regional development and industrial agglomeration being carried out in economic geography proper.},

First, I find that different types of neighborhood-level social diversity have different spatial patterns, and thus may require different supportive planning strategies. Second, an increase in density predicts an increase in social diversity, but only up to a point. Third, providing varied housing unit types is an important means for promoting diversity, but offering a variety of housing values and choice between renting and owning is also important. Fourth, older urban and pre-World War II suburban areas are the most socially diverse places in the Chicago area. This may be a strength of first-tier suburbs that deserves more attention. Finally, the diversity of any residential area is in constant flux. Planners interested in sustaining diversity should focus in particular on areas where it is in decline.},

After introducing neighbourhood effects into the theoretical model, we test the methodology using data on 8,429 firms established in the municipalities making up the Spanish region of Murcia. Our results show that human capital, agglomeration economies and industrial land availability are the main factors driving entrepreneurs' decisions. Estimates of the spatial component of the model indicate that spillovers or externalities taking place between municipalities (inter-territorial spatial effects) have a remarkable influence on the location decisions of the firms, thus confirming the need to account for such spatial dependence pattern when studying location decisions of industrial companies at a local level.},

We focus on legal nonpayment, and show that almost 40 percent of vehicles at meters are both not paying and not breaking any laws. The majority of nonpayment comes from vehicles displaying disabled credentials. These credentials undermine the effectiveness of priced parking and appear to invite substantial fraud.},

At the same time, barriers within the policy process could mitigate against the meaningful incorporation of environmental justice concerns. The paper concludes with a discussion of how greater inter-departmental and community collaboration in policy development, as well as the more routine application of an environmental justice lens, could mitigate the ill effects of the inequitable distribution of environmental and other resources.},

That metropolitan region planning institutions are comprised of this new composite, termed multi-scalar large institutional networks (MSLIN), has implications for theory, practice, and research, because they evolve, learn, and act on emergent phenomena and via emergent processes in extraordinarily complex and dynamic settings in ways radically distinct from individual organizations and institutions.

Using hierarchical modeling, the results indicate that even with strong controls for individual variables, residents of areas with more highly accessible and gridded street networks have higher health ratings. At the same time, residents of more densely populated urban areas have lower rated health, net of individual-level measures. Measures of sprawl have no significant relationship to frequency of walking, body mass index, or diagnosis of various chronic diseases. However, among those with chronic conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, and lung disease, those who live in areas with more highly connected street networks have higher rated health.},

We assessed the population's status and conservation options for its habitat using a spatially explicit population model coupled with a fisher probability of occurrence model. The fisher occurrence model was selected from a family of generalized additive models (GAM) generated using numerous environmental variables and fisher detection\textendash{}nondetection data collected at 228 survey arrays sampled repeatedly during 2002\textendash{}2006. The selected GAM accounted for 69\% of the Akaike weight using total above-ground biomass of trees, latitude-adjusted elevation, and annual precipitation averaged over a 5 km2 moving window. We estimated equilibrium population sizes (or carrying capacities) within currently occupied areas, and identified likely population source, sink, and expansion areas, by simulating population processes for 20 years using different demographic rates, dispersal distances, and territory sizes. The population model assumed that demographic parameters of fishers scale in proportion to habitat quality as indexed by the calculated probability of fisher occurrence. Based on the most defensible range of parameter values, we estimate fisher carrying capacity at $\sim$125\textendash{}250 adults in currently occupied areas. Population expansion into potential habitat in and north of Yosemite National Park has potential to increase population size, but this potential for expansion is predicted to be highly sensitive to mortality rates, which may be elevated in the northern portion of the occupied range by human influences, including roadkill and diseases carried by domestic cats and dogs.},

  abstract = {If neighborhood design can support or undermine active lifestyles, then residents of new urbanist neighborhoods can be expected to exhibit higher levels of physical activity than residents of conventional communities. This study compared various measures of physical activity for residents of a new urbanist neighborhood to those for a group of conventional suburban neighborhoods in central North Carolina, finding no statistically significant differences, even after adjusting for individual and household characteristics. However, we did detect differences in where people were physically active. Residents of the new urbanist neighborhood were more likely to be physically active in their neighborhood than were residents of conventional suburbs. This difference was due to their walking more for utilitarian purposes, as distinct from walking for leisure. Despite the limitations of a quasi-experimental research design, our results raise questions regarding new urbanism's ability to raise residents' overall levels of physical activity.},

Understanding the Latino urban experience and developing plans to better respond to both the needs of Latino communities and their integration within society is not only relevant, but also urgently necessary. Using the city of Los Angeles as a main lens, in addition to a general look at the urban Southwest, we contribute to the scholarship on the subject with a review of literature on Latino communities. We structure the review as an assessment of the various challenges and opportunities for urban Latinos in the pre-war, postwar, and contemporary city. Focusing on space, culture, economy, and governance, we chart the various roles both the private and public sectors play in meeting these challenges. Our reading of the literature shows that particular government actions in the economic and governance domains in the past had positive impacts on Latino integration, and we call for a similar effort today in addressing contemporary challenges. We conclude by suggesting that future planning scholarship on Latino communities engage the wider urban studies literature, focus on emerging forms of urbanization, and call on planners to sustain increased academic and practical interest in the topic.},

In 1944, it was declared in ``need of renewing''; by 1970, barely a shell of Bayside remained. With tree-lined streets and Greek Revival, Italianate, and Second French Empire architecture, Bayside hardly fit the stereotype of a slum. This study not only examines Bayside's changing socioeconomic configuration but also (within the context of the progressive housers' rhetoric about deslumming) explores the Depression-era and post-World War II government-energized crusade against blight. Like Robert Fogelsong and Alison Isenberg find for larger cities, the study sees this Bayside-dooming campaign as having much more to do with saving the downtown from the threat of suburbia and white flight than with providing safe and sanitary housing and decent neighborhoods to the urban poor.},

A new approach to fair-share compliance, called ``growth share,'' has now been proposed, which seeks to break out of the paradox by giving deference to local governments on land use development issues so long as affordable housing opportunities are created simultaneously and in fair proportion to the actual growth experienced by each municipality. Potential strengths and weaknesses of this new approach are explored.},

  abstract = {One of the defining characteristics of the ``communicative turn'' in planning is the rejection of technocratic instrumental (means-ends) rationality as the principal source of legitimacy for planning procedures. Procedural quality is now seen as grounded equally in the tenets of participatory democracy: inclusiveness, reciprocity, good communication, empowerment, mutual learning. Such ideals have become widely accepted (even if they are not always well implemented in practice). However, this trend seems to have had little effect on the products of strategic planning processes\textemdash{}plans\textemdash{}which, in the public sector, seem mostly to present recommendations as the logical (instrumentally rational) response to conditions. This article discusses the step from ``collaborative'' process to ``logical'' product as a problem of translation, drawing on actor-network theory and social linguistics to activate this concept. The discussion is informed by two case studies from Australia. Though the translation problem was dealt with in a very different way in each case, the (perceived) need to produce a conventional plan negatively affected both processes' adherence to participatory ideals. In conclusion, the paper asks whether the conservativeness of the plan as a genre might have conservative effects on the practices of public planning agencies, and whether alternative modes and/or translation processes might be found to mitigate these effects.},

(For the full argument see Flyvbjerg, 2001.) Second, we must address problems that matter to groups in the local, national and global communities in which we live, and we must do it in ways that matter; we must focus on issues of context, values and power, as advocated by great social scientists from Aristotle and Machiavelli to Max Weber and Pierre Bourdieu. Finally, we must effectively and dialogically communicate the results of our research to our fellow citizens, the `public', and carefully listen to their feedback. If we do this \textendash{} focus on specific values and interests in the context of particular power relations \textendash{} we may successfully transform social scientific research into an activity performed in public for publics, sometimes to clarify, sometimes to intervene, sometimes to generate new perspectives, and always to serve as eyes and ears in ongoing efforts to understand the present and to deliberate about the future.

  abstract = {Evidence suggests that built environments will need to function under climatic conditions different from the recent past. Observed warming temperatures and changes in precipitation already suggest that historical observations and personal experience may not be reliable guides to future conditions. Yet, uncertainties remain about future climatic conditions, particularly at local and regional scales where land use planning decisions are made. Faced with this uncertainty, responding to climate change will require identifying key vulnerabilities of the built environment and developing adaptive strategies for reducing the risk of harmful impacts. One area of potential vulnerability is stormwater management. Increased precipitation due to climate change could exacerbate the impairment of surface waters due to increases in stormwater runoff. This study considers the potential effectiveness of low impact development, specifically compact development with decreased impervious cover, for reducing stormwater impacts on surface water under changing precipitation patterns. The study location is a redevelopment project south of Boston, MA, USA. A simple stormwater model, SGWATER, is used to assess the sensitivity of stormwater runoff and pollutant loads to changes in impervious cover, precipitation volume, and event intensity. Simulation results suggest that when expressed on a constant percent basis, stormwater runoff is most sensitive to changes in site impervious cover, followed by changes in precipitation volume and event intensity. The study illustrates, in a simple but quantitative way, the potential benefits of a common low impact development practice for increasing the resilience of communities to changing precipitation patterns.},

While the ``interdependent'' framing was most influential in the region studied, the multi-level, multi-sector nature of the network ensured that it was not unchallenged. Instead, an open arena for learning and dialogue about long-term and holistic approaches to planning was established. This allowed a core definition of sustainable development that integrated environmental limits with basic human needs (long term and global) to have a real and practical impact on decision making.},

Neither change in transport modes nor residential suburbanization is principally responsible for shaping the outward spiral of urbanization. Manufacturing began its outward march from the outset of the city's industrialization, establishing peripheral nodes of employment and working class residence within San Francisco, then beyond the city limits in South San Francisco and especially the East Bay. The main cause of decentralization has been industrial shifts; the outbreak of new activities in new places, normally in the form of industrial districts at various spatial scales. A second cause has been the orchestration of development by business leaders through property ownership and political manoeuvring guided by a general vision of metropolitan expansion, whether in co-operation or competition with one another.},

These counties contained over 26 million residents in 2000, or more than I in II Americans. Their residents were clearly more diverse and occupied more densely built environments in 2000 than was the case just 30 years before. As a result, though they are not truly urban, they are very different from suburbs of the past in form and character. Our four case examples trace development trends, transportation improvements, and changing politics in these increasingly complex, post-suburban places. We recommend that planners focus on the future in these places, even when they are booming, anticipating the unique challenges they will lace as their growth slows. These similar counties face common problems, and may benefit from sharing successful strategies for making themselves more attractive and economically viable in the long run.},

Based on initial empirical findings from Swedish local government, we argue that inside activism is empirically relevant but not satisfactorily covered by other key actor concepts. We theorize that inside activism is 1) dualistic: open, deliberative, consensus-seeking and tacit, tactical, power-driven; 2) influential through informal networking inside and outside of government; and 3) dynamic as it varies over time and between critical situations. Due to current trends in society and public administration (e.g. governance), we expect inside activism to be increasingly relevant and we encourage further theoretical, empirical as well as normative research and discussion on this phenomenon.},

  abstract = {This review paper contends that by paying attention to the quality of life issues raised by older people, planners may promote better places for all. Recent research in the UK that asked older people to identify quality of life criteria revealed that health, income, social networks, community participation, information, activities, home, neighbourhood and mobility are key areas where old age can be enriched. The paper argues that of these, home, neighbourhood and mobility are paramount for four reasons. Firstly, older people are seen as situated, even fixed, in domestic environments; secondly, society has responded to later life by creating age-segregated spaces; thirdly, lessening mobility may increase the importance of the local arena and fourthly the interplay between the self and the environment underpins or undermines independence. The significance of place means that planners, even more than other professionals, need to be age aware. Drawing on recent national and international research this paper contemplates what a more age-friendly place might be like and considers how issues of age can interact with the broader planning agendas of sustainability, cohesion and liveability to create places that promote well-being for every member of the community.},

Consequently, open space has been used to address urban concerns of health and sanitation, suburban concerns of exclusionary zoning, and more recently, to protect ecological functions and guide urban development. This has prevented a more thorough examination of the relationship between nature and society.},

While rights may grant a particular kind of access to planning venues to create opportunities for challenging prevailing policy views about reconciliation, these opportunities may also be vulnerable to planning system changes. Drawing upon the case of Haida Gwaii, this paper tells a story about a dispute over territorial rights that have been squeezed out of institutional venues for over a century. In seeking to have this dispute heard, the Haida Nation have sought out blockades and the courts, achieving a collaborative planning arrangement with the Province of British Columbia in 2009. These events are set in contrast to a more recent environmental assessment that was initiated by the Government of Canada to consider the controversial Northern Gateway (tar sands) pipeline and tanker project. It is argued that a series of environmental planning reforms tied to this project review are likely to impinge upon the very strategies used by the Haida Nation to achieve collaboration.},

It describes the significance of water to indigenous people living in the Roper River area of Australia's Northern Territory, reports on innovations in water allocation planning processes aimed at accommodating that significance, and analyses the implications of this case study for water planning generally. We describe rich cultural and historical connections with water places, protocols governing human conduct towards water, custodial assertions regarding the need for ``water for the country'', distinctive values relating to riparian vegetation, and claims of ownership and economic rights in contemporary water allocations. Current water planning objectives such as sustainable development, protection for groundwater-dependent ecosystems, and protection of indigenous values accord with contemporary indigenous perspectives in the Roper, and in a national first, the local water plan specifically proposes reserving a significant water allocation for commercial use by indigenous people. Yet that allocation is seen as unjust from a local perspective, and further analysis demonstrates a range of other limitations: the scale and boundedness of the demarcated plan area, the neglect of riparian vegetation management, insufficient resourcing of local indigenous capacity, mismatches in planning and local governance structures, and the broader question of whether a rationalist planning process can simultaneously advance indigenous claims for recognition, equity in distributions and parity in participation.},

  abstract = {Problem: Does how planners talk about issues have an impact on public support? Purpose: I examine whether the words used to describe a policy make a difference for the level of acceptance of that policy. Methods: I conducted a random survey of suburban residents. One-half of the sample were randomly chosen to answer a question about their support for affordable housing; the other half were asked to answer the identical question except that it substituted the words lifecycle housing for the previous phrase. Results and conclusions: The difference in wording produced a difference in public opinion of more than 30 percentage points, with those whose question referred to lifecycle housing expressing greater support. This difference was significant among White, non-Hispanic respondents; there was no significant difference among other (non-White) respondents. The phrase affordable housing seems to be stigmatized and perhaps associated with race among the residents of this affluent, White suburb. This study examines public support in the context of an opinion survey and these results may not apply to attitudes about actual projects or policies. Takeaway for practice: Under the right circumstances, the words planners use might expand policy options available to local officials. Proper framing may allow some previously infeasible policies to succeed. Research support: None},

Therefore, working with such media is a prerequisite for effective public impact of planning research. Using the example of megaproject planning, it is illustrated how so-called ``phronetic planning research,'' which explicitly incorporates in its methodology active and strategic collaboration with media, may be helpful in generating change in planning practice via the public sphere. Main lessons learned are as follows: (1) working with mass media is an extremely cost-effective way to increase the impact of planning scholarship on practice; (2) recent developments in information technology and social media have made impact via mass media even more effective; (3) research on ``tension points,'' that is, points of potential conflict, are particularly interesting to media and the public, and are especially likely to generate change in practice; and (4) tension points bite back; planning researchers should be prepared for, but not afraid of, this.},

In this paper we will argue that new academic fashions, new international institutional arrangements, new communications technology and new developments in data availability, have all renewed the need for a redevelopment of analytical industrial location theory. Our paper will argue that the microeconomic foundations of industrial location theory must now be reconsidered. In particular, the methodological basis of traditional industrial location models needs to be reconciled with recent models of clustering, the new economic geography literature, and also more aggregate systemic levels of analysis. We will argue that in order to do this it is necessary: first, to specify the transactions-cost assumptions underlying these various approaches; second, to adopt broader definitions of spatial transactions costs; and third, to incorporate environmental characteristics within an orthodox location-production type of framework. The insights gained by this integrated micro- level approach will also provide new directions for more aggregate systemic approaches, as well as clarifying the both the strengths and limitations of the currently fashionable models of clustering.

Although the link between global economic change and gentrification has been made for the upper classes who are the consumers of the gentrified landscape, very little work has been done on the blue-collar work and workers that remain in the central city despite the assumption by policymakers that deindustrialization is complete. I argue that manufacturing is still a viable sector of the urban economy that is increasingly at risk of displacement because of the conversion of industrial space to residential use and speculative real-estate pressure. In this way, gentrification is encouraging industrial displacement, which in turn is leading to the degradation of the blue-collar work that remains and to the increasing informalization of work.},

The authors review previously used measurement schemes and discuss conceptual assumptions that underlie each. Using 2013 March Current Population Survey data, the authors estimate national- and race-specific rates of working poverty using more than 125 measures. The authors then evaluate the association between each measure and a latent construct of working poverty using factor analysis and develop a working poverty index derived from these results. Finally, the authors estimate multivariate regression models to identify key social and demographic risk factors for poverty among workers. The authors' national estimates of working poverty range from 2\% to nearly 19\% and are highly sensitive to alternative assumptions. The authors' analyses find that the latent construct is most highly correlated with empirical measures of working poverty that include part-time or part-year employment and that use poverty income thresholds that include both the poor and near poor. Crude rates and conditional risks of poverty among workers vary considerably among racial groups. This article provides a conceptual and empirical baseline for decisions about how best to estimate the magnitude and composition of America's working poor population.},

The study shows that reframing socio-spatial imaginaries influences the spatiality of the city/the polder, including a spatial identity, advocates certain solutions, and further enables institutional actors to reframe climate issues strategically to benefit other planning objectives as well as weaving together environmental agendas with economic agendas. However, new framings are challenged by some citizens/actors. At an institutional level, framing of planning may hence serve to relocate tensions and engage citizens and stakeholders in hard transitions, thus revealing implications beyond the discursive.},

Despite formidable limitations on the extension of the police power before Euclid v. Ambler in 1926, the first comprehensive zoning ordinances were passed in New York city (1916) and Chicago (1923) where existing patterns of corporate-commercial development added complexity to the political process. This article examines how the zoning problem assumed particular dimensions in Chicago, shaped by a distinctive local geography, vested interests of an established real estate market and long-term planning objectives articulated in the 1909 Plan of Chicago. By focusing on the contentious issue of regulating building height and bulk in an established corporate-commercial district, this article illustrates how health and safety considerations were necessary to the political success of comprehensive zoning in Chicago, providing the necessary justification for the extension of the municipal police power.},

This paper explores urban river revitalization in contemporary China, focusing particularly on ongoing efforts to clean up Foshan's polluted Fenjiang River. The research shows that the traditional cultural status of the waterway, which is known as the ``Mother River'' of Foshan, plays a paradoxically pivotal role in the project to modernize it. Interacting in complex ways with domestic and international political concerns, and popular media and internet technologies, the cultural status of the river has helped to determine both the type of environmental movement that has emerged in its defence, and the community of interests that serves as a proxy for civil society in that movement. Ultimately, this paper argues that the unique configuration of institutions and actors engaged in the Fenjiang River restoration project are emblematic of a new type of ``environmentalism with Chinese characteristics.''},

  abstract = {Economic incentive theory is used to examine whether the attractive properties of Habermasian dialogue can be achieved in public goods provision. The aim is to enhance realism in the expected results of communicative planning. Hard trade-offs must be made, as manipulation and exclusion cannot be eliminated from democratic processes while other desirable qualities are retained. Demand-revealing schemes can remove citizens' motives to misrepresent their preferences for public goods and ``free-ride'' on others' contributions. However, the planners designing these schemes might have motives to behave opportunistically and collect too much money for administering the system. Two proposals for reducing this surplus and correcting the demotivating effects of its collection are studied. Results show that new participatory planning bodies are required to make amendment procedures work. Hence, some efficiency problems in public goods provision can be solved by expanding dialogue. This reveals a noteworthy common interest between communicative planners and economists.},

The rebuilding of New Orleans and surrounding areas of Louisiana and Mississippi will require the largest and most complex planning effort in my lifetime. To succeed, we must learn from disasters of the past, while also applying the planning knowledge of the present. From past disasters, we know that successful reconstruction requires both outside funding and local citizen involvement. As planners, we know that the processes should be rich in data, imagination, communication, and participation. Optimistically, a new New Orleans will involve improved flood safety, revitalized neighborhoods, housing opportunities for all, and equitable treatment of all residents. Planners have an obligation to take an active role and advocate for the funding and full participation necessary to achieve these goals. The alternative would be a city that is poor, unsafe, and unequal. This is the greatest planning problem most of us have ever seen, and it warrants a correspondingly large response.},

The ability of communities to plan and determine their futures is at stake. Yet communities are not homogenous, and as we speak of improving the planning process, we must ask questions about what it will take to ensure the participation and influence of those who in the past have been the victims of that process. How can the planning process be opened to communities who have been bulldozed by urban renewal, redlined into apartheid-like conditions, deserted by capital, or indeed, revitalized virtually out of existence? The commitment to social justice requires planning professionals to look closely at the deadly consequences of uneven development and ask ``What can we do to make the community planning process more equitable?''},

This review discusses different needs for different types of natural and human-induced disasters. It also discusses the role for an integrated, multimodal approach for evacuation planning to assist with evacuating people in the most efficient manner possible. This literature review serves to characterize the current state of thinking and practice on the subject of carless and special needs evacuation planning. The focus of the literature review is on the role of government and public agencies. Overall, the literature related to carless evacuation planning is multidisciplinary and wide ranging. The events surrounding Hurricane Katrina motivated this review of existing research and provided an opportunity to synthesize other earlier related research. The process is important for finding gaps in the contemporary understanding of these issues, especially given more recent evacuations.},

This paper tries to resolve some of the main shortcomings in the empirical literature on location decisions for new plants, that is, spatial effects and over-dispersion. Spatial effects are omnipresent, being a source of over-dispersion in the data as well as a factor shaping the functional relationship between the variables that explain a firm's location decisions. Using count data models, empirical researchers have dealt with over-dispersion and excess zeros by developments of the Poisson regression model. This study aims to take this a step further by adopting Bayesian methods and models in order to tackle the excess of zeros, spatial and non-spatial over-dispersion, and spatial dependence simultaneously. Data for Catalonia (Spain) are used and location determinants are analysed to that end. The results show that spatial effects are determinant. Additionally, over-dispersion is decomposed into an unstructured independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) effect and a spatially structured effect.},

We focus on rural settlements in the Brazilian north-east, where land reallocation has been approached in a variety of ways over many decades. The study identifies problems deriving from the lack of a plan-led strategy, leading to failures in identifying sustainable areas and designing appropriate policy interventions on a regional scale. Based on the planning literature and our empirical results, it is proposed that different views on land reform should be combined into a broader regional strategy. This involves strategic targeting of specific areas to define a portfolio of investment and spending priorities, combined with intergovernmental and intersectoral co-ordination, running from the early stages of a project's formulation until the final stages of its implementation. Additionally, this paper shows that combining top-down and bottom-up approaches to land reform, and supplementing policy-making at the national level with programme/project design and implementation at the subnational level, allows an effective government response to rural poverty and landlessness.},

Reflecting on the case through theories of place, gentrification, and planning process, we argue that resident resistance was not simply a case of self-interested NIMBYism, but a product of important differences in the ways that character was variously constructed and valued by local authorities and community members.},

The Court's majority view saw a cohesive nation where past assumptions of the racist geographies of the USA centered on the `Deep South' no longer hold true. The Court's minority view, saw a nation still deeply divided and subject to second-generation discriminatory practices. The contradictions of both are discussed. The resiliency of the Act and the implications of the ruling are examined.},

  abstract = {In the ongoing debate over the social benefits and costs of gentrification, one of the key questions left largely unaddressed by the empirical literature is the degree to which gentrification impacts local labor markets. This paper begins by exploring the nature of employment change in one archetypical gentrifying neighborhood\textemdash{}Chicago's Wicker Park\textemdash{}to motivate the central hypothesis that gentrification is associated with industrial restructuring. Next, a detailed analysis is presented on the long-term employment changes in neighborhoods that have experienced gentrification during the 1990s across a sample of 20 large central cities. Specifically, this paper uses Freeman's (2005) definition to define tracts that experienced gentrification and compares employment outcomes in such tracts and those within a \textonequarter{} mile buffer to comparable non-gentrified tracts. This analysis shows that employment grew slightly faster in gentrifying neighborhoods than other portions of the central city. However, jobs in restaurants and retail services tended to replace those lost in goods producing industries. This process of industrial restructuring occurred at a faster rate in gentrifying areas. Thus gentrification can be considered a contributory and catalytic factor in accelerating the shift away from manufacturing within urban labor markets.},

  abstract = {Planning practice requires ongoing interaction between regulatory ``facts'' and deliberative ``norms''. Played out in local and strategic developments, ``norms'' are the agreed values and positions developed by advancing deliberative engagement of residents; while ``facts'' are the more rigid statutory procedures through which planning decisions are typically made. However, conflict arises between residents' groups and local government decision-makers when deliberative norms, now a key tenet of strategic planning processes, struggle to gain traction in the factual spaces provided by statutory planning regulations. A contentious planning process in St Kilda, Melbourne, Australia (concerning the redevelopment of a car park into a commercial and public space) highlights the challenges to deliberative engagement in highly-regulatory planning systems. Drawing on this contested case, this paper examines how the broader formal and relatively fixed framework of regulatory-based decision-making fails to support participatory principles, undermining both the desired communicative ethos and enduring collaborative outcomes and norm development. Specifically, the paper problematises tensions between residents' growing expectations for greater transparency and participation in planning, arising from a growing regard for deliberation in strategic planning, and the hegemonic nature of statutory planning that preserves planning control within the formal domain of government and the private sector.},

Distinction may be sought in productive structure, consumption and identity. In this paper, contradictory trends towards homogenisation and distinctiveness are theorised. Studying the occupational structure of 50 large US metropolitan areas, it is found that distinctiveness has been increasing in economic base occupations though some heavily blue-collar cities' edge is eroding. Employment in consumption activities has been growing faster than in the economic base and cities are becoming more alike in consumption structure. It is concluded that the search for niches in exporting sectors and related occupational mix is key to urban resurgence.},

  abstract = {Abstract Neoliberal urban redevelopment is often represented as consensual, socially-neutral `local economic development' with a positive effect on both a city's overall economy and its level of racial and ethnic diversity. The purpose of this article is to focus specifically on the key ideological premises of color-blind racial discourses that help facilitate and provide necessary legitimacy (and ideological cover) for neoliberal urban redevelopment in a mid-sized US city. Color-blind racial discourses facilitate the agenda and mandates behind tax abatements, enterprise zones, public\textendash{}private partnerships and new forms of urban consumption. Despite efforts to the contrary, neoliberal urbanism does not retreat from race \textemdash{} rather, racial dynamics are reconstituted to accommodate processes of capital accumulation and uneven urban development in poor and minority cities. Drawing on the case of Chester, Pennsylvania, this article focuses on how color-blind racial discourses influence exclusionary urban redevelopment policies and practices, facilitate their implementation and legitimize their outcomes. R{\'e}sum{\'e} On pr{\'e}sente souvent le r{\'e}am{\'e}nagement urbain n{\'e}olib{\'e}ral comme un `d{\'e}veloppement {\'e}conomique local' consensuel et socialement neutre, dont b{\'e}n{\'e}ficient {\`a} la fois l'{\'e}conomie g{\'e}n{\'e}rale et le degr{\'e} de diversit{\'e} raciale et ethnique de la ville. Cet article s'int{\'e}resse en particulier aux grands principes id{\'e}ologiques des discours racialis{\'e}s de type color-blind (litt{\'e}ralement, aveugle aux couleurs) qui contribuent au r{\'e}am{\'e}nagement urbain n{\'e}olib{\'e}ral d'une ville am{\'e}ricaine moyenne et fournissent la l{\'e}gitimit{\'e} (et la caution id{\'e}ologique) au projet. Ces discours facilitent les objectifs et missions que soutiennent cr{\'e}dits d'imp{\^o}t, aides {\`a} l'installation dans certaines zones d'activit{\'e}, partenariats public-priv{\'e} et nouvelles formes de consommation urbaine.

The first is by evolving a deeply considered humanist philosophy for planning and tracing its implications for practice. The second is by adapting planning practices to their real-world constraints with regard to scale, complexity, and time. The third is by translating knowledge and ideas generated in other fields into the domain of planning.

Both the general public and nonprofit organizations have been willing to spend billions of dollars on land preservation because of a perception that traditional land use planning and regulation are not successfully accommodating growth or protecting valuable natural resources. The literature on smart growth has largely overlooked the potential of land preservation to curb sprawl and to foster livable communities. The literature on land preservation has focused on the mechanics of conservation easements and land purchases rather than on how land preservation can fit in the comprehensive planning process to achieve community smart growth goals. More research needs to be done on the strategic use of land preservation in shaping and directing growth as part of a comprehensive planning effort.},

routine, codifiable job tasks. Applying a spatial equilibrium model, we
corroborate four implications of this hypothesis. Local labor markets
that specialized in routine tasks differentially adopted information
technology, reallocated low-skill labor into service occupations
(employment polarization), experienced earnings growth at the tails
of the distribution (wage polarization), and received inflows of skilled
labor.},

As a practice, economic development is an essential component of local policy and governing and a perceived driver of success and vitality for cities and regions alike.

Using a three-tiered approach, we undertake a compara- tive analysis of the way in which practitioners and scholars undertake economic development. Through a study of Economic Development Quarterly journal keywords and a review of nine cities' economic development initiatives, we assess the most frequent topics and initiatives within the discipline. Using the International Economic Development Council best practice awards, we look at what is generally viewed as ``successful.''

We then assess three food hub sites in Seattle, Washington, using our typology and characteristics that should be considered (audience, ownership, purpose, design and siting, and scale). Our assessment demonstrates that the strengths, viability, and vitality of each food hub are derived from attributes not currently considered by the most commonly used, type-focused definitions of food hubs. Our contribution adds clarity to the evolving discussion about food hubs, and describes elements for communities, particularly the planning community, to consider when planning for them.},

The research uses social worlds analysis to reveal that the plan's technical advisors did not find facts through the collective discovery of scientific truths with unitary meanings, but instead constructed facts by aligning professional visions of space, time, and agency. The validity of the resulting plan relied on its ability to be a ``boundary object'', meaning different things to different groups, while simultaneously laying claim to universality and objectivity. However, its subsequent failure to satisfy an unexpected scientific peer review demonstrates the importance of anticipating downstream reception and use when developing such documents. This case study shows that planners can be epistemic mediators, creating and stabilizing technical knowledge claims that project authority by showing a responsive face to many audiences.},

The right course of action is always a matter of choice, never of fact. Planners should engage in the political process as advocates of the interests of government and other groups.

The research spans 7 years, covering the period before relocation and demolition had begun and ending after mixed-income redevelopment was completed. Residents who lived in three public housing projects that were revitalized are compared to a control group of residents who lived in three projects that were not revitalized, showing that mixed-income revitalization greatly accelerated the residential mobility of public housing residents and that household displaced by revitalization did not experience a statistically significant loss of housing assistance. Households that relocated by using vouchers or by moving to mixed income revitalized communities experienced significant improvements in their socioeconomic status, and they moved to higher quality neighborhoods. Additionally, their long-run socioeconomic status was similar to the status of households who moved from housing projects voluntarily, i. e., not in response to a planned demolition. This is one of few empirical studies of the efforts of HOPE VI revitalization on public housing residents, and its conclusions argue against the elimination of funding for HOPE VI as called for in the president's budget for 2006.},

This article shows that the national spatial imaginary is racially marked, and that segregation serves as a crucible for creating the emphasis on exclusion and augmented exchange value that has guided the contemporary ideal of the properly-ordered, prosperous private home. For aggrieved communities of color and other non-normative populations, on the other hand, a different spatial imaginary exists. This perspective on space revolves around solidarities within, between, and across spaces. It views space as valuable and finite, as a public responsibility for which all must take stewardship. Privileging the public good over private interests, this spatial imaginary envisions the costs of environmental protection, efficient transportation, affordable housing, public education, and universal medical care as common responsibilities to be shared rather than as onerous burdens to be avoided. This paper argues for a two-part strategy that entails first, a frontal attack on all the mechanisms that prevent people of color from equal opportunities to accumulate assets that appreciate in value and that can be passed down across generations, and second, the embrace of a spatial imaginary based on privileging use value over exchange value, sociality over selfishness, and inclusion over exclusion.},

The benefits of compactness are compromised, however, if higher densities and more intense land use create urban heat islands, which increase water and energy use. This study examines the effects of Phoenix's urban heat island on water use by single-family residences, controlling for relevant population and housing attributes. Our statistical analysis demonstrates that increasing daily low temperatures by 1$^\circ$ Fahrenheit is associated with an average monthly increase in water use of 290 gallons for a typical single-family unit. These results suggest that planners should consider effects on water demand as well as other environmental consequences when they evaluate growth strategies, and use incentives to encourage efficiency and sustainability.},

  abstract = {In 2010 the American Community Survey (ACS) replaced the long form of the decennial census as the sole national source of demographic and economic data for small geographic areas such as census tracts. These small area estimates suffer from large margins of error, however, which makes the data difficult to use for many purposes. The value of a large and comprehensive survey like the ACS is that it provides a richly detailed, multivariate, composite picture of small areas. This article argues that one solution to the problem of large margins of error in the ACS is to shift from a variable-based mode of inquiry to one that emphasizes a composite multivariate picture of census tracts. Because the margin of error in a single ACS estimate, like household income, is assumed to be a symmetrically distributed random variable, positive and negative errors are equally likely. Because the variable-specific estimates are largely independent from each other, when looking at a large collection of variables these random errors average to zero. This means that although single variables can be methodologically problematic at the census tract scale, a large collection of such variables provides utility as a contextual descriptor of the place(s) under investigation. This idea is demonstrated by developing a geodemographic typology of all U.S. census tracts. The typology is firmly rooted in the social scientific literature and is organized around a framework of concepts, domains, and measures. The typology is validated using public domain data from the City of Chicago and the U.S. Federal Election Commission. The typology, as well as the data and methods used to create it, is open source and published freely online.},

I begin with a brief overview of the main principles of regionalism, culminating in the ideas of the RPAA, and then analyze how these ideas either connect or conflict with New Urbanism and its particular brand of the regionalist paradigm. An essential question for New Urbanists is how their particular version of regionalism stands up against earlier versions, and whether theirs will have a better chance of being implemented.},

Increasingly concepts of sustainable development are finding their way into local and regional development strategies. This is also true in the USA, though not through the Local Agenda 21 process, as is the case in much of the rest of the world. The approach to ?sustainable development? in the USA is a set of policy approaches collectively referred to as ?smart growth?. Smart growth is sometimes referred to as a uniquely ?American? variant of sustainable development. In contrast to Local Agenda 21, smart growth has captured the imagination of American policy-makers, at all spatial scales. Many have lauded smart growth as a market-based approach that promotes the tripartite concerns of sustainability. This paper positions smart growth in the context of broader political economic change and scrutinizes its incentive-based approach through a case study from the Boston, Massachusetts, region.

Using census data, oral histories, archival documents, and newspaper accounts, this study analyzes residential segregation and neighborhood disinvestment over a 60-year period. Without access to capital, housing conditions worsened to the point that abandonment became a major problem. By 1980, many of the conditions typically associated with large cities were present: high unemployment, poor schooling, and an underground economy that evolved into crack cocaine, gangs, and crime. Yet some neighborhood activists argued that the redlining, predatory lending, and housing speculation were worse threats to community viability. In the early 1990s, the combination of low property values, renewed access to capital, and neighborhood reinvestment resulted in gentrification, displacement, and racial transition. Portland is an exemplar of an urban real estate phenomenon impacting Black communities across the nation.},

  abstract = {Planners have significant influence on the fiscal landscape of communities through the day-to-day decisions they make and the plans they implement. To better understand how our educational system addresses fiscal issues in the training of planners, the author surveyed planning instructors from across the United States and Canada and analyzed a series of public finance course syllabi. This article presents the results of this analysis and contrasts the planning instructor survey results with the results of a national survey focused on practicing planners. In this second survey, planners were asked to provide their perspectives on the importance of public finance to effective planning. Taken together, the survey results provide an interesting picture of the significance of public finance to planning academics and practitioners. This research is intended to assist planning programs in evaluating their curricula for attention to public finance and the needs of the planning profession.},

Although security is necessary for creating spaces the public will use, making it a top priority is often criticized for restricting social interaction, constraining individual liberties, and unjustly excluding certain populations. This study examines legal, design, and policy tools used to exert social and behavioral control in publicly accessible urban spaces. Based on a review of the relevant literature and extensive site visits to spaces in New York City, we create an index that uses 20 separate indicators in four broad categories to quantify the degree to which the use of a space is controlled. Since comparable instruments do not exist, we propose our index be used to evaluate publicly accessible spaces. We suggest several potential applications useful in planning practice and for testing theories about public space.},

This article examines this issue in the context of Siem Reap, Cambodia, in the shadow of Angkor Wat.The authors introduce a conceptual framework motivated by Roland Barthes and Jean Baudrillard to unravel and delineate four distinct sources of value, derived respectively from use, exchange, symbol, and myth. This framework is then deployed to show how these valuations of place have evolved over three distinct eras: the ancient Khmer period, the French colonial era, and the more recent postcolonial period. In this context the authors show how contemporary economic development in Siem Reap has been shaped by a lingering mentality by which the ``meaning'' of Angkor continues to be adjudicated by external perspectives. The authors argue for an economic development strategy that seeks to resituate Angkor within the context of a newly articulated meaning of the place from a more locally informed perspective.},

Four CFAs led by professionals with planning backgrounds employed spatial mapping techniques to analyze a variety of issues, explored more and diverse community-food linkages, used multiple sources and methods, envisioned a key role for community planning agencies, distributed their findings widely to a local and national audience of professional planners, and helped place planners in leadership positions of the national community food security movement.

This research is motivated by new Scottish guidance which encourages designations in general, and LLDs in particular, to be more positive, strategic tools for rural development activities. LLDs were originally conceived to protect and enhance significant areas of valued countryside yet they remain neglected in contemporary planning research and policy. A critical assessment of LLDs across Scotland was undertaken using both primary and secondary data. The results reveal a significant mismatch between positive national guidance and local authority policy and planner attitudes, the latter characterised by more protectionist positions and limited strategic planning. Although case study findings in Aberdeenshire reveal that more planning applications in LLDs have conditional approvals as opposed to the wider countryside, key differences have more to do with the subjective views and priorities of planning committees rather than the efficacy of LLDs per se. The article concludes that the current conceptualisation, operation and performance of LLDs needs to be more robust, and better aligned to reflect a positive focus on community and rural development matters in order to differentiate them from wider countryside policies. However, augmenting resources to reflect the increased attention to the landscape agenda in Scotland is a core prerequisite.},

  abstract = {Complexity is integral to planning today. Everyone and everything seem to be interconnected, causality appears ambiguous, unintended consequences are ubiquitous, and information overload is a constant challenge. The nature of complexity, the consequences of it for society, and the ways in which one might confront it, understand it and deal with it in order to allow for the possibility of planning, are issues increasingly demanding analytical attention. One theoretical framework that can potentially assist planners in this regard is Luhmann's theory of autopoiesis. This article uses insights from Luhmann's ideas to understand the nature of complexity and its reduction, thereby redefining issues in planning, and explores the ways in which management of these issues might be observed in actual planning practice via a reinterpreted case study of the People's Planning Campaign in Kerala, India. Overall, this reinterpretation leads to a different understanding of the scope of planning and planning practice, telling a story about complexity and systemic response. It allows the reinterpretation of otherwise familiar phenomena, both highlighting the empirical relevance of the theory and providing new and original insight into particular dynamics of the case study. This not only provides a greater understanding of the dynamics of complexity, but also produces advice to help planners implement structures and processes that can cope with complexity in practice.},

The research uses a chaining technique to study the scale and impact of the displacement of office and industrial occupiers in the Tyne and Wear conurbation. The status and origin of occupiers of 20 office and industrial developments, promoted or assisted by the public sector, have been recorded to determine the distance that they have moved and the number of net new jobs generated. Property chaining reveals the extent to which the filtering effect has resulted in reoccupation of buildings and permits the quantification of the amount of property remaining vacant and its location. Analysis of the recorded chains has revealed that more than half of all occupiers on assisted schemes have relocated within the Tyne and Wear area and one in three occupier chains generated by such relocations result in vacant property elsewhere within the metropolitan area. The displacement of employment and economic activity within the conurbation can be mapped and could be used to inform the action of public agencies to reduce or ameliorate the negative side-effects of their intervention. The chaining technique proves an elegantly simple and robust technique by which to determine the scale and distribution of occupier displacement in property markets. G REENHALGH P., D OWNIE M.

Co-ordination in these structures is primarily achieved by competition, command and co-operation, respectively. The case study focuses on co-operation. It gives an account of how the administrative agencies of public roads, railways, civil aviation and coastal infrastructure work together in the Norwegian national transport planning process. The administrations take varying interest in the integrated plan and have different degrees of power in the co-ordination process, which has caused some tension. The divergent co-operation strategies chosen by the agencies are partly due to dissimilar sources of funding and organization models. These features and the degree of agency interest in the co-ordination effort are influenced by the relative strength of market elements and hierarchical elements guiding their operations. It is therefore meaningful to explain the agencies' more or less co-operative strategies by utilizing the concepts of governance structure and co-ordination.},

New information and communication technologies today provide the opportunity to explore storytelling through multimedia, including video/filmmaking, in what we describe as digital ethnography. While there has been a tradition in the planning field of using film for advocacy purposes since the 1920s, we argue for a new direction informed by collaborative planning theory and situational ethics. This paper reports on a three-year, three-stage research project in which we experimented with the use of film as a mode of inquiry, a form of meaning making, a way of knowing, and a means of provoking public dialogue around planning and policy issues (in this case, community development and the social integration of immigrants). We explored the expressive as well as analytical possibilities of film in conducting social research and provoking community engagement and dialogue, taking advantage of the aesthetic and involving dimensions of film as narrative. The research question was a socio-political one: how do immigrants become integrated into a specific social fabric, and how do they acquire a sense of belonging? The site of the research was a culturally diverse neighbourhood in the city of Vancouver, and the specific focus was a place-based local institution, the Collingwood Neighbourhood House. The paper concludes with critical reflections on the use of film in this research project, focusing on ethical issues, power relationships, insider/outsider dilemmas, and reciprocity.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are widely accepted as a technology offering an alternative way to tackle complex and dynamic problems in urban studies. The goal of this article is a review of current literature in the field of planning and AI. The aim of this review is to increase the understanding of how AI approaches urban and land dynamics modeling processes and how, as a result, researchers can structure that knowledge and choose the correct approaches to embed in their models. For this purpose, the authors review the applications of AI techniques in urban land dynamics domain as well as the emerging challenges they face. The authors discuss hybrid AI systems as a need resulting from the trend in planning policy to develop more holistic approaches. The authors conclude that, although challenges exist, AI-based approaches offer promising solutions for urban and land dynamics.},

Berkeley's progressives won control of the city government and tried to implement the proposed housing policies, which included strong rent controls to shield tenants from rising rents and using taxes and exactions to divert part of the city's increasing real estate values toward production of nonprofit affordable housing. Conservative antitax activists and real estate interests were able to use appeals to the state courts, lobbying the state legislature and statewide initiatives to weaken or block many of the progressive programs.},

The typology can be linked to the Californian bungalow court concept, transmitted via professional journals, trade magazines, and study tours. While the standard American model evolved toward denser clusters of urban apartment buildings, the Melbourne paradigm remained resolutely suburban. The first planned estates in the 1920s featured detached, middle-class houses fronting handsome public streets. Later developments were less bespoke and connect to the rapid expansion of the cul-de-sac form in postwar suburban housing estates. In mass production, the holistic, collective integrity of the Pasadena prototype proved difficult to discern.},

The paradigm shift from plan to project provides an impetus to reconsider the dualistic relation between plan and project in a progress review of planning literature from the classics to a flurry of recent empirical studies of major projects and `strategic' spatial plans.

One of the chief motivations for these policies is the dispersal of subsidized housing as a means of deconcentrating poverty. This article examines the deconcentrating effects of one desegregation lawsuit, Hollman v. Cisneros in Minneapolis. The Hollman case incorporated three means of dispersal: (I) redevelopment of public housing and the relocation of displaced families, (2) a housing mobility program, and (3) development of scattered-site replacement housing. In this case, despite full implementation of the consent decree, a very limited amount of dispersal actually occurred. Marketing the mobility program and suburban replacement housing to inner-city families has proven very difficult, and most poor families remain in central city neighborhoods. These findings call into question the underlying assumptions of a deconcentration approach to alleviating poverty in the inner city.},

  abstract = {Using daily discharge data from the USGS, we analyzed how hydrologic regimes vary with land use in four large hydrologic regions that span a gradient of natural land cover and precipitation across the continental United States. In each region we identified small streams (contributing area \&lt; 282~km2) that have continuous daily streamflow data. Using a national database, we characterized the composition of land cover of the watersheds in terms of aggregate measures of agriculture, urbanization, and least disturbed (``natural''). We calculated hydrologic alteration using 10 ecologically-relevant hydrologic metrics that describe magnitude, frequency, and duration of flow for 158 watersheds within the Southeast (SE), Central (CE), Pacific Northwest (NW), and Southwest (SW) hydrologic regions of the United States. Within each watershed, we calculated percent cover for agriculture, urbanized land, and least disturbed land to elucidate how components of the natural flow regime inherent to a hydrologic region is modified by different types and proportions of land cover. We also evaluated how dams in these regions altered the hydrologic regimes of the 43 streams that have pre- and post-dam daily streamflow data. In an analysis of flow alteration along gradients of increasing proportion of the three land cover types, we found many regional differences in hydrologic responses. In response to increasing urban land cover, peak flows increased (SE and CE), minimum flows increased (CE) or decreased (NW), duration of near-bankfull flows declined (SE, NW) and flow variability increased (SE, CE, and NW). Responses to increasing agricultural land cover were less pronounced, as minimum flows decreased (CE), near-bankfull flow durations increased (SE and SW), and flow variability declined (CE). In a second analysis, for three of the regions, we compared the difference between least disturbed watersheds and those having either \&gt; 15\% urban and \&gt; 25\% agricultural land cover. Relative to natural land cover in each region, urbanization either increased (SE and NW) or decreased (SW) peak flows, decreased minimum flows (SE, NW, and SW), decreased durations of near-bankfull flows (SE, NW, and SW), and increased flow variability (SE, NW, and SW). Agriculture had similar effects except in the SE, where near-bankfull flow durations increased. Overall, urbanization appeared to induce greater hydrologic responses than similar proportions of agricultural land cover in watersheds. Finally, the effects of dams on hydrologic variation were largely consistent across regions, with a decrease in peak flows, an increase in minimum flows, an increase in near-bankfull flow durations, and a decrease in flow variability. We use this analysis to evaluate the relative degree to which land use has altered flow regimes across regions in the US with naturally varying climate and natural land cover, and we discuss the geomorphic and ecological implications of such flow modification. We end with a consideration of what elements will ultimately be required to conduct a more comprehensive national assessment of the hydrologic responses of streams to land cover types and dams. These include improved tools for modeling hydrologic metrics in ungauged watersheds, incorporation of high-resolution geospatial data to map geomorphic and hydrologic drivers of stream response to different types of land cover, and analysis of scale dependence in the distribution of land-use impacts, including mixed land uses. Finally, ecological and geomorphic responses to human alteration of land cover will have to be calibrated to the regional hydroclimatological, geologic, and historical context in which the streams occur, in order to determine the degree to which stream responses are region-specific versus geographically independent and broadly transferable.},

Yet research on performance measurement in spatial planning is still rare. The `Best Value' performance management framework imposed by the UK central government has precipitated a flurry of initiatives amongst English local planning authorities. This article reports on innovations in performance measurement amongst some of these local authorities, reviewing the objectives and mechanisms of measurement, as well as the drivers and inhibitors of measurement behaviour. The research reflects a nationally fragmented picture of measurement and uneven innovation within and amongst authorities, but highlights a number of initiatives that show promise as the basis upon which to develop a more holistic framework for measurement in the future, both in the UK and elsewhere.},

A new framework for empirical analysis is developed applying theoretical categorizations of power and democratic legitimacy. Housing planning in Norway and Finland is studied and compared. Lukes's three dimensions of power allows the structural power relations embedded within habitual planning practices and legal frameworks to be identified, while authority and manipulation are observable empirically in case studies involving conflicts. As the study reveals, output legitimacy is emphasized, and discussion of procedural aspects of the cases is avoided.},

Papers on individual regions find that HOV lanes may increase or decrease welfare, while more general papers find that the impact of HOV lanes depends on underlying parameters. The Clean Air Act assumes that HOV lanes reduce traffic volume and improve air quality and recommends HOV lanes to areas with poor air quality. This research finds there is no consensus on HOV lane impacts and, that using HOV lanes as a travel control measure may be misguided, but that further research is warranted.},

These trends, going back several decades, are highlighted in Figure 1. Their persistence seems inconsistent with stories of a recent or sudden crisis in the US manufacturing sector. After all, as recently as 2010, the United States had the world's largest manufacturing sector measured by its valued-added and, while it has now been surpassed by China, the United States remains a very large manufacturer.},

This shift by employers towards 'flexiwork', in combination with high unemployment and the legacy of a sharply racially segmented labour market under apartheid, is re-segmenting a dual labour market. An increasingly polarised labour market is emerging, consisting of a growing number of marginalised 'flexiworkers' next to a 'core' workforce of black and white workers who increasingly also feel the threat of insecurity. The use of flexible labour is partly a response to a well-organised labour movement which has won shopfloor rights over the past decade and has succeeded in getting these rights entrenched in law. Although the labour movement has committed itself to organise 'flexiworkers', it is a long way from innovative responses to the challenge of flexibility.},

Using evidence drawn from a wider study of the relationships between places and youth drinking cultures, the paper discusses young adults' use of pubs. While recognising the adverse effects of heavy drinking, arguments are put forward in support of the traditional pub as a site for restrained and responsible social interaction for young adults.

The exploration is conducted through a critical analysis of the redevelopment of Jackson Square, a low-income area in Boston where community development corporations are leading redevelopment after a vision was crafted through a participatory planning process. Through the analysis of the changes in the plan and the role of the community, the nonprofit sector and the local state in the implementation phase, this research argues that the effects of responsibilization are seriously burdening the nonprofit sector, which may be acting as a buffer between the community and the local state. The research also highlights the importance of addressing financial feasibility during the visioning phases and keeping the community engaged during the implementation of the plans.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0091991},
  abstract = {Current developments in the field of land use modelling point towards greater level of spatial and thematic resolution and the possibility to model large geographical extents. Improvements are taking place as computational capabilities increase and socioeconomic and environmental data are produced with sufficient detail. Integrated approaches to land use modelling rely on the development of interfaces with specialized models from fields like economy, hydrology, and agriculture. Impact assessment of scenarios/policies at various geographical scales can particularly benefit from these advances. A comprehensive land use modelling framework includes necessarily both the estimation of the quantity and the spatial allocation of land uses within a given timeframe. In this paper, we seek to establish straightforward methods to estimate demand for industrial and commercial land uses that can be used in the context of land use modelling, in particular for applications at continental scale, where the unavailability of data is often a major constraint. We propose a set of approaches based on `land use intensity' measures indicating the amount of economic output per existing areal unit of land use. A base model was designed to estimate land demand based on regional-specific land use intensities; in addition, variants accounting for sectoral differences in land use intensity were introduced. A validation was carried out for a set of European countries by estimating land use for 2006 and comparing it to observations. The models' results were compared with estimations generated using the `null model' (no land use change) and simple trend extrapolations. Results indicate that the proposed approaches clearly outperformed the `null model', but did not consistently outperform the linear extrapolation. An uncertainty analysis further revealed that the models' performances are particularly sensitive to the quality of the input land use data. In addition, unknown future trends of regional land use intensity widen considerably the uncertainty bands of the predictions.},

Defining areas as housing submarkets may be better for choosing, analyzing, and predicting the effects of revitalization policies than defining them as historically recognized neighborhoods if these neighborhoods do not reflect consumer behavior. The first key step in the submarket approach is to ascertain whether current definitions of neighborhoods adequately represent submarkets defined by consumer assessments of housing quality. This article uses the neighborhood planning of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to illustrate how quality-leveldefined housing submarkets compare to planners' administrative boundaries and historically recognized neighborhoods. The housing submarkets of the city diverge substantially from planner-defined geographic areas of analysis. This finding suggests that predefined neighborhoods, while valid for some purposes, do not define areas for predicting the housing-market response to policy.},

In particular, we integrate regionally valued ecosystem services on the supply side of an Input\textendash{}Output Table to quantify what natural resources offer to economic development. Using several different indicators, we show the benefits of the ecosystem services under the status quo and a scenario for regional development. Our results suggest that economic activities should be encouraged to use the ecosystem services more intensively, while landscape development should aim at providing the required services. We conclude that such an approach can provide a platform for decision-makers to learn quantitatively about the dependency of the regional economy on natural services.},

This has been measured in terms of EIA `effectiveness', especially as discussion has moved away from issues of procedural implementation, to the more substantive goals of EIA and its place within broader decision-making contexts. Empirical studies have revealed the relatively weak degree of influence on planning decisions that is being exerted by EIA, which is increasingly being attributed to its rationalist beginnings. This article seeks to direct this debate towards the founding political purposes of EIA which, it is argued, provide a neglected, yet strong, basis for EIA reform. A number of illustrative suggestions are made as a result of this redirection, to enable EIA to adopt a more determinative role in decision making and to contribute to more sustainable patterns of development planning.},

The paper reviews some traditional issues, including those introduced by Louis Winnick, who coined the phrase in the title, and also introduces some new ones. It suggests that 'sense of place' is relevant to the policy debate, because sense of place is a factor in regional and local identity and is an important form of intangible capital that has positive externalities. The paper relies on principles of benefit-cost analysis, and it notes that a concern for the sense of place is consistent with some recent developments in economic theory, namely in the theory of household production and theories of 'fairness' and community values. It also includes an appreciation of the work of Ben Chinitz, whose emphasis on 'supply' in regional analysis is consistent with a respect for the sense of place and is also relevant to a discussion of 'place prosperity vs people prosperity'.},

Based on data from the San Francisco Bay Area, we find that jobs-housing balance reduces travel more, by a substantial margin.

We conclude that a lack of sustainable framing in different governance domains hampered their conversion into reality. ``Speed'' and ``urgency'' developed instead as an important action frame, fostering an investment agenda focusing on competitiveness, the development of a high-end service sector, and further enhancement of tourism. This proved unsuitable for facilitating participatory processes and strategic debates about the future of the city.},

In this article we challenge that view. We argue that debates about alternative urban development in the U.S. overemphasize urban industrial transition as a process of rupture, whereby strong business-led political regimes displace an old economic order in favor of a new corporate-centered, FIRE-oriented, downtown development model. In contrast, we suggest many cities have experienced post-industrial neoliberalism in more muted fashion, characterized by a condition of political economic stasis, where old industries and political interests persist alongside new economic strategies and developments. A brief discussion of Akron, Ohio, Lexington, Kentucky, and Tacoma, Washington illustrates the dynamics at work in such cities. We argue that stasis and the weakness of the mainstream orthodoxy in some cities provide a context in which alternative economic development might be more viable.},

We develop a method that uses cluster analysis to group US central cities; then we employ discriminant analysis to establish the statistical validity of those groups. We also develop techniques to minimise the role of judgement in selecting the appropriate cluster solution. The second purpose of the article is to test the substantive null hypothesis. Our rejection of the homogeneity assumption raises the spectre of specification error in research and public policies that assume homogeneity among central cities.},

  abstract = {This article proposes contemporary best-practice recommendations for stated preference (SP) studies used to inform decision making, grounded in the accumulated body of peer-reviewed literature. These recommendations consider the use of SP methods to estimate both use and non-use (passive-use) values, and cover the broad SP domain, including contingent valuation and discrete choice experiments. We focus on applications to public goods in the context of the environment and human health but also consider ways in which the proposed recommendations might apply to other common areas of application. The recommendations recognize that SP results may be used and reused (benefit transfers) by governmental agencies and nongovernmental organizations, and that all such applications must be considered. The intended result is a set of guidelines for SP studies that is more comprehensive than that of the original National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Blue Ribbon Panel on contingent valuation, is more germane to contemporary applications, and reflects the two decades of research since that time. We also distinguish between practices for which accumulated research is sufficient to support recommendations and those for which greater uncertainty remains. The goal of this article is to raise the quality of SP studies used to support decision making and promote research that will further enhance the practice of these studies worldwide.},

Purpose: I aim to describe and analyze an example of how local governments can function as civic enablers and capacity builders for collaborative and accountable planning among neighborhood stakeholders and city government. Methods: This is a case study of Seattle's neighborhood planning approach in the 1990s based on semistructured interviews with 33 current and former planners, other officials, and neighborhood activists, and review of a broad selection of neighborhood plans and other planning documents and newspaper coverage of the planning process. Results and conclusions: The city of Seattle developed a set of tools and resources to empower local citizens in the planning process while also holding them accountable for actions consistent with specified broad values and planning targets. This, together with the city's substantial investment in neighborhood planning staff, who served as relational organizers and intermediaries of trust, was critical to the success of neighborhood planning and to the emergence of a collaborative governance culture among highly diverse and often contentious community associations, business interests, city departments, and the city council. Takeaway for practice: Diverse neighborhoods can find common ground and make positive progress on planning to address shared citywide concerns. However, they need staff assistance to do this. Neighborhood planners can play this role, but only if cities fund them to do this time-consuming work and provide institutional support and guidance.},

Although many transportation decisions have affected this central New York city, among the most important are those surrounding the state and interstate highways through Syracuse (New York State Thruway and Interstates 81 and 690). The author traces important steps and events in the city's decisions to allow major highways to traverse the city center, decisions that had important effects on patterns of urban formation, growth, and decline. The case is another illustration of the importance of urban freeways in city history. Information sources are historical archives and secondary data. The case suggests that Syracuse falls into a class of cities whose fates are dependent to a great extent on major forces linked to the transportation sector but whose urban infrastructure decisions and growth patterns are not alike. These patterns are related to a set of interacting phenomena\textemdash{} from timing of transportation decisions within an environment of changing state and federal funding opportunities and environmental law to governmental philosophy. Central to the city outcome was the convergence, before and relatively early in the evolution of environmental and preservation law and policy, of the city planning goals of ``slum clearance'' and redevelopment (later, urban renewal), on the one hand, and the transportation goals of eliminating congestion and improving vehicle mobility, on the other. Also important was the availability of nonlocal funding to a fiscally conservative city administration, one that was also deferential, often legally obligated to be, to state highway planning directions.},

Ethnic identity is presumed to be self-evident. Drawing on the political theory of Young and Gilroy the paper questions the basis for ethnic identity as a group membership. These theorists suggest that through attention to relationships between ethnic groups we can open up space to challenge existing ethnic power relations. The paper draws upon qualitative research in two English local authorities to explore how long-standing conceptualisations of ethnicity act to diminish the positive contribution that attention to difference can have. The findings suggest that planners make positive efforts to understand ethnic difference and engage with community groups. However, the identification of groups is not a neutral or objective process, but instead is power-ridden. This article argues that the progressive edge of planning and efforts of planners are undermined if we do not interrogate the basis for the understanding of ethnic difference.},

The combination of a hedonic price model and a household survey conducted in Harris County, Texas, indicates that flood hazard was an important factor in households' housing decisions, but not hurricane and toxic materials hazards. The results have further suggested that home buyers were poorly informed about hurricane and toxic materials hazards when housing decisions were made and came to understand their vulnerability only while living in hazard-prone neighborhoods. Moreover, it appears that low-income households and minorities were the least-informed group in the housing market. These findings provide implications for using hazard information programs to promote community resilience to natural hazards and community environmental justice.},

It then analyses the Greek educational curricula in two ways: (1) a quantitative analysis classifying courses into different thematic areas and thereby, revealing the basic structure of the curricula; and (2) a qualitative analysis based on interviews with academic staff in charge of educational curricula and examining the content of courses, the adopted pedagogies and possible restrictions (e.g. human capital, institutional framework, etc.) in introducing effective planning curricula. Finally, the article proposes guidelines for re-orienting educational curricula in Greek schools of planning and draws out wider implications for planning studies in the wider European and international context.},

This research examines the nature of the creative class using a variety of measures: occupational and demographic profiles, talent and diversity, an expert survey of successful downtowns, creative class accoutrements, and case studies.

The analysis of these three cases reveals serious attempts to translate sustainability into federal programs and changes in agency cultures despite institutional barriers. Although the primary outcome of these efforts was a stronger framework for facilitation of planning at the federal level, it still remains unclear why planners were not more involved in this process.},

Combining interpretive approaches from planning history and economic geography, this article discusses one such proposal, the Joint Report with Comprehensive Plan and Recommendations, proposed in 1920, by the New York/New Jersey Port and Harbor Development Commission, as a response to the traffic problems generated by New York City's innovative, small-batch manufacturing economy. Pointing out some of the limitations of the established explanations for the dramatic decline of this industrial center, the article argues that the nondevelopment of any local freight infrastructure similar to that proposed by the Joint Report closed off the continued development of the city's materially productive economy as a historical possibility.},

We hypothesize that local consumption activity can be a source of such distinctiveness and thus of long-term growth and stability, and that specialization does not reflect export activity alone. Using skewness across metropolitan regions in the United States as a distinctiveness measure, we show that some occupations are more lopsided in their distribution than others. Because some highly skewed occupations like health care support workers and artists, media, entertainment, and sports workers are known to be chiefly local-serving; their regional significance can be attributed to variations in residents' local consumption spending rather than export demand. We conclude that economic development practitioners should weigh the considerable investments, including subsidies and tax incentives, made in wooing and retaining presumptive export base activities against those that might target distinctive local consumption activities.},

Using the 2005\textendash{}07 American Community Survey, this paper analyses the extent of geographical disparities in occupational segregation by race/ethnicity across US states. The results show that there is a great geographical variation in segregation. A large part is driven by spatial disparities in workers' characteristics, mainly due to differences in the distribution of ethnic/racial minorities and their immigration/linguistic profiles. Taking these characteristics into account reduces this variation and reshapes the segregation map, with the highest segregation moving from states in the Southwest to those in the East Central region, where minorities face more segregating labour markets.},

In this article, these dilemmas are explored by examining the interaction in Britain between the planning system and electricity distribution companies around the long-running issue of undergrounding, i.e. could companies reduce the visual intrusiveness of their overhead networks by placing more lines underground, especially in valued landscape areas? The research shows that although the consents process, development plans and collaborative endeavours all provide apertures for influencing investment, in most instances companies underground their rural networks to the extent that it fits with their technical and economic priorities. Improving locally embedded partnerships between the main actors is unlikely to change this position significantly. The challenge is to bridge the institutional dislocation between the `case-by-case approach' to addressing the environmental impacts of overhead lines in the planning system and the largely a-contextual, economic imperatives of national market regulation.},

Children in the interview evidenced rich connections with their home environment and local community, but often did not produce ``good'' maps. Maps are useful as a tool for talking with children about their lives but, on their own, can give planners only limited insights into children's ``real world'' environmental cognition and community connection.},

  abstract = {There is now substantial literature describing the importance of home gardens for a variety of quality of life variables such as avoidance of stress, recreation and personal and social identity. From a water resource management perspective it is reasonable to hypothesise that those households that gain the most personal benefits from their gardens will use more water. Consideration of the relationship between quality of life and external water use needs to be made if policies in relation to demand management, supply reliability and restrictions are to reflect community values adequately. In this study, estimates were made of external water use, the total water use outside home (e.g. on lawns, gardens, or swimming pools) for 397 households in detached housing in Perth, WA. Measurements were made of a variety of socio-demographic variables which may affect water use. These included income, block size, swimming pool ownership and so on. In addition five latent attitudinal or quality of life variables were measured. These were the importance of garden and natural space for personal lifestyle satisfaction, interest in gardening, attitudes towards the garden as a source of recreation, attitudes to water conservation and a social desirability scale. External water use was modelled using structural equations with the latent variables. The expected socio-demographic variables such as block size or swimming pool ownership were found to influence water use. Lifestyle, garden interest and garden recreation activities were found to be related but all had a direct influence on external water use. Attitudes towards water conservation unlike previous studies also directly affected external usage. It appeared that the interaction between attitudinal and socio-demographic influences were minimal on external water use. The significance of these findings for evaluating the performance of water utilities on the social dimension of sustainability is discussed. Finally, the need for appropriate specificity in attitudinal and water use measurement in demand prediction studies is highlighted.},

  abstract = {Problem: In the 30 years since its creation, has Portland, Oregon's, urban growth boundary (UGB) become something more than a regulation? Spirited debate about its impacts on land uses and values has inspired vivid descriptions by both supporters and critics and spurred the imagination of artists and creative writers. Purpose: The UGB has become a symbol, metaphor, and touchstone, as people read complex meanings into it that go beyond its simple legal function. This article looks at the UGB as a cultural icon. It explores the increasingly complex ways in which people have tried to describe, understand, and interpret the UGB as part of the regional landscape as well as the regulatory system. It examines metaphorical descriptions of the UGB as well as the growing body of depictions in nature writing, poetry, novels, photography, performance art, songs, and other exercises of the artistic imagination. Methods: We review how supporters and critics of the UGB have described it and how artists have depicted it in various media. Results and conclusions: Although many planning projects have become icons, few planning regulations have done so. Artistic interpretations have familiarized and humanized the UGB and embedded it in the consciousness of everyday life. Artists thus make the invisible more visible or legible. Acting as a viewfinder, the UGB offers an opportunity for conversation and interpretation from multiple perspectives. Takeaway for practice: In the world of 21st-century planning theory there is a strong assumption that many voices engaged in overlapping conversations can help shape more equitable and sustainable cities. Creative depictions of Portland's UGB show the role of cultural actors in shaping and enriching such conversations. Research support: None.},

  abstract = {The central concern of this paper is the relationship between research-driven ``state-of-the-art'' knowledge, and knowledge claims made in practice, in planning for sustainability. The paper approaches this topic from a critical realist perspective, which is used to provide criteria for positing ``state-of-the-art'' knowledge validity, and assessing the quality of situated knowledge claims in planning practice. In this way the paper contributes to debates about an ontological turn in planning knowledge. By reviewing key planning documents in three Scandinavian city regions, the paper shows that the knowledge claims about travel behavioral impacts of proposed land use and transport infrastructure presented in the documents are, to varying extents, in accordance with ``state-of-the-art'' academic knowledge on these topics. Some long-standing ``planning myths'' are encountered in the investigated planning documents. In one of the cities, residential and workplace location close to suburban public transport stops is highlighted as a traffic-reducing measure, rather than proximity to inner-city concentrations of jobs and other facilities, and density is discussed at a neighborhood scale rather than at a city scale. In all three cities, planning documents depict road capacity increases as having no traffic-generating effect. These latter claims are used in support of more decentralized land-use patterns and considerable road development. Since the likelihood of achieving sustainability goals relies heavily on whether the measures chosen are productive or counter-productive, knowledge obviously matters. A stronger focus on how well suited proposed strategies for spatial development are to produce their purported outcomes should be welcomed in planning research and practice.},

Many assume that eating local food is more ecologically sustainable and socially just. We term this the local trap and argue strongly against it. We draw on current scale theory in political and economic geography to argue that local food systems are no more likely to be sustainable or just than systems at other scales. The theory argues that scale is socially produced: scales (and their interrelations) are not independent entities with inherent qualities but strategies pursued by social actors with a particular agenda. It is the content of that agenda, not the scales themselves, that produces outcomes such as sustainability or justice. As planners move increasingly into food-systems research, we argue it is critical to avoid the local trap. The article's theoretical approach to scale offers one way to do so.},

Pet{\'e}n's farmers now must compete with larger, more efficient, and often subsidized producers elsewhere in the country and beyond, whereas large-scale commercial farmers and ranchers are flocking to the region because of its improved access and other factors. Household survey data from one agriculturally important area indicate that most households have become poorer and their farming systems less diverse and that the concentration of land and wealth is intensifying. Results suggest that infrastructure aimed at enhancing economic integration can marginalize the majority in a previously remote region, particularly when little is done to support residents' ability to compete economically.},

  abstract = {Spatial concepts play a major role in planning practices all over the world. Some of them rise to the surface and then disappear, others remain thriving for a long time, becoming mobilized to shape politics, public policy and projects. By analysing two important spatial concepts in Dutch planning practice (mainport and corridor), this paper aims to explore the mobilizing capacities of new spatial concepts. The paper argues that the success of spatial concepts in the political arena depends on the interplay of two elements: (1) the concept's meaning, which effectively imagines the spatial challenge, and (2) the presence of a powerful coalition that uses this concept to name, frame and claim. The more meanings a concept accumulates, the more support it attracts. However, as this paper shows, this only holds if a major condition is being met: that the different meanings of the concept do not mutually conflict or contradict. This article presents a method by which to analyse the concept's meanings and to track conceptual changes.},

We find that institutional differences across local labor markets not only shape how immigrants develop skills in specific places but also determine the localized obstacles they face in demonstrating and harnessing these skills for employment. To explain the role of local institutions in shaping differences in skill development experience and opportunities, we draw on the concept of tacit skill, a term that is rarely incorporated into studies of the labor market participation of less educated immigrants. We argue that innovative pathways that Latino immigrant workers have created to develop tacit skill can strengthen advocacy planning efforts aimed at improving employment opportunities and working conditions for marginalized workers, immigrant and nonimmigrant alike.},

It then focuses on two major attempts to secure full employment through legislation. The Full Employment Bill of 1945 was defeated; the compromise, the Employment Act of 1946 did not have full employment as its goal. After years of struggle, a much-weakened HumphreyHawkins Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 passed, but then was violated and virtually ignored. Full employment shifts power from capital to labor, so major opposition can be expected from efforts to obtain it. Proponents need more power and a strong movement, including at the grassroots level, pushing for jobs for all\textendash{}not just jobs for me or my group. Publicizing the benefits of past job programs and
reintroducing the idea of a decent-paying job as a right are suggested, as well as making decent jobs for all the center of economic policy.

Despite much emphasis on the apparent interpenetration of society and the economy, contemporary economic sociology is rooted in an analytical distinction between the two spheres. The implicit reliance on the neoclassical economic conception of the market helps to explain why the `new economic sociology' often collapses into disequilibrium economics, where disequilibrium becomes the central but unstated prediction of a good deal of the work in the paradigm. Using a sample of contributions from the field, I demonstrate that a strong tendency running through much of the new economic sociology tends to understand society as a fundamentally distortionary force. To resolve this problem, I argue that an independent field of economic sociology necessitates a distinction between social relationships and social relations.},

  abstract = {Although ecological restoration is widely used to combat environmental degradation, very few studies have evaluated the cost-effectiveness of this approach. We examine the potential impact of forest restoration on the value of multiple ecosystem services across four dryland areas in Latin America, by estimating the net value of ecosystem service benefits under different reforestation scenarios. The values of selected ecosystem services were mapped under each scenario, supported by the use of a spatially explicit model of forest dynamics. We explored the economic potential of a change in land use from livestock grazing to restored native forest using different discount rates and performed a cost\textendash{}benefit analysis of three restoration scenarios. Results show that passive restoration is cost-effective for all study areas on the basis of the services analyzed, whereas the benefits from active restoration are generally outweighed by the relatively high costs involved. These findings were found to be relatively insensitive to discount rate but were sensitive to the market value of carbon. Substantial variation in values was recorded between study areas, demonstrating that ecosystem service values are strongly context specific. However, spatial analysis enabled localized areas of net benefits to be identified, indicating the value of this approach for identifying the relative costs and benefits of restoration interventions across a landscape.},

However, green spaces have a proven positive effect on people living in the neighborhood of green spaces, as well as on people working or recreating in the urbanized area. Therefore, green infrastructure investments have been put high on the agenda in many European countries. In order to convince the public and other stakeholders of the usefulness of these kind of green investments, it is necessary to give a correct, understandable and easily repeatable method to value the investment. The current article describes a model that can be used to put the value of green infrastructure investments into economic terms. Evaluating the project at site scale and regional scale will give a complete overview of all direct, indirect and use values of the investment. By using cost\textendash{}benefit as well as multiplier analyses the monetary values can be estimated. The article shows that using this model helps to justify policy's support for and investment in green space.},

In Europe, greater transnational networking and cooperation on spatial planning, often facilitated by European initiatives, have resulted in planning policy makers at different levels being increasingly influenced and exposed to policies and practices from elsewhere. These processes might be assumed to be leading to some sort of convergence of spatial planning policy. However, this is not necessarily the case: there are deeply embedded differences between nations in terms of political, professional, and administrative cultures and structures. There are also significant differences in social models and welfare systems across Europe, as well as different histories. These differences, which are explored conceptually and empirically in this article, potentially put a brake on the idea of the convergence or harmonization of national and sub-national arrangements for spatial planning.},

Specifically, I argue that whereas New Urbanism rejects the key design tenets of modernist planning and strives to revive premodern urban forms (and in this sense qualifies as ``postmodern''), it contradicts one of the foundational premises of postmodern thought\textemdash{}the commitment to pluralism. I further argue that this contradiction relates to a fundamental challenge facing New Urbanists planners: how to achieve premodern urban design ideals within the economic and technological conditions of contemporary society. I illustrate these themes and contradictions with examples of historic and recent planning in the Cleveland region.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.ecolecon.2012.05.008},
  abstract = {This article considers the importance of robust planning for green infrastructure in fast changing Southern African cities. A key theme is the extent to which ecosystem services are valued publicly, and the opportunity costs of not investing in the green infrastructure. We explore green infrastructure through pairing insights of social\textendash{}ecological resilience with perspectives on urban infrastructure transitions. By converging these views, we show how green infrastructure can be viewed as an innovative response to challenged urban environments.

Through a Johannesburg case study, a number of ecosystem services constitute sources of resilience for an otherwise constrained city. While this is positive and to be valorised, many South African cities are in the midst of service delivery protests, so that resilient ecosystems, and the citizen networks that sustain these, are largely overlooked in planning processes.

This article offers three key conclusions. First, a proper understanding of green infrastructure requires blending insights from social\textendash{}ecological system thinking and infrastructure transition scholarship. Second, there is a paucity of knowledge around ecosystem services in Johannesburg, and that the planning to facilitate ecosystem service valuation is largely inadequate. Third, addressing this requires ecosystem valuations relevant to the unique conditions in developing world cities such as Johannesburg.},

The results indicate that living in areas with higher ethnic concentrations increases both the likelihood of carpooling and of taking public transit. Furthermore, working in an ethnic niche is a strong predictor of carpooling versus driving alone in five metropolitan areas, and of taking transit versus driving alone in four metropolitan areas.},

In addition, while some individual socioeconomic characteristics such as income, educational attainment, and ownership status have similar effects on location choices as in developed market economies, factors that characterize institutional forces still play significant roles in residential location choices. These findings reveal the coexistence of market mechanisms and socialist institutional forces in shaping the unique location choice decisions of households in this transitional Beijing.},

The job accessibility measure applied in this research captured travel impedance and both job supply and demand. The results suggested that spatial mismatch still existed and that it continued to increase over time. However, the spatial pattern of mismatch had changed. Low-income job seekers were more disadvantaged in the inner-ring suburbs, mainly because of the lag in the residential suburbanization of low-income job seekers. This research contributed to the understanding of the extent and consequences of urban spatial transformation and suggested that social equity problems be addressed from a broader spatial perspective.},

To ground our welfare analysis, we develop a heterogeneous agent general equilibrium model in which the distortions generated by place-based policies depend upon a set of reduced form elasticities which our empirical work centers on estimating. Using rejected and future applicants to the EZ program as controls we find that EZ designation substantially increased employment in zone neighborhoods, particularly for zone residents. The program also generated wage increases for workers from zone neighborhoods worth approximately \$320M per year. Based upon estimates of the number of jobs created for zone residents, we find that EZ employment credits generated deadweight costs equal to (at most) seven percent of their flow cost.},

Proposing corrective regulation that enforces technological fixes or market-based approaches is often met with political resistance and doubts about its effectiveness.

Yet, understanding the complexity of integrated human-environmental systems can help planners and stakeholders frame environmental problems, view their role in them and design effective policies to address them. This article examines the potential and limitations of agent-based models as metaphors that can contribute to the understanding of such complex systems, illustrating the argument with a hypothetical application in groundwater management.},

In governance literature, discourse networks are seen as a threat to representative democracy. This article argues that the consequences for democracy depend on the type of network that develops and its performance in relation to democratic norms. Governance networks are discussed through the lens of democratic network governance, the utility of which is explored as an analytical tool in a case study of urban planning in Norway. In this context a governance network was constructed as a response to market-orientated planning practice in order to enhance citizen participation and public debate. The aim of this article is to discuss the relevance of the theory of network governance relating it to new forms of participation in public planning processes. The study shows that governance networks could strengthen democracy, though important questions about meta-governance, however, remain unsolved. The article also shows that networks operating in an institutional vacuum tend to fail in institutional capacity building.},

  abstract = {This paper describes techniques to compute and map dasymetric population densities and to areally interpolate census data using dasymetrically derived population weights. These techniques are demonstrated with 1980-2000 census data from the 13-county Atlanta metropolitan area. Land-use/land-cover data derived from remotely sensed satellite imagery were used to determine the areal extent of populated areas, which in turn served as the denominator for dasymetric population density computations at the census tract level. The dasymetric method accounts for the spatial distribution of population within administrative areas, yielding more precise population density estimates than the choroplethic method, while graphically representing the geographic distribution of populations. In order to areally interpolate census data from one set of census tract boundaries to another, the percentages of populated areas affected by boundary changes in each affected tract were used as adjustment weights for census data at the census tract level, where census tract boundary shifts made temporal data comparisons difficult. This method of areal interpolation made it possible to represent three years of census data (1980, 1990, and 2000) in one set of common census tracts (1990). Accuracy assessment of the dasymetrically derived adjustment weights indicated a satisfactory level of accuracy. Dasymetrically derived areal interpolation weights can be applied to any type of geographic boundary re-aggregation, such as from census tracts to zip code tabulation areas, from census tracts to local school districts, from zip code areas to telephone exchange prefix areas, and for electoral redistricting.},

With their monumental architectural style, broad boulevards and landscaped public plazas, these proposals draw heavily from planning's early City Beautiful roots and challenge the idea that Los Angeles had only a ``brief infatuation'' with the movement. This article considers a number of these proposals, paying particular attention to two schemes that bookend the local movement: the 1907 plan prepared by Charles Mulford Robinson for the Municipal Art Commission and the plan prepared by the Allied Architects Association in the mid-1920s. While neither was implemented in full, the discussions that surrounded their adoption demonstrate a continued local interest in aesthetically oriented planning at a grand scale. A close reading of these plans, and especially the ways in which the authors attempt to communicate their ideas visually provides an opportunity to consider how the profession incorporated competing ideas about art and science, professional expertise, race and real estate, in its attempt to persuade public officials and the public at large to act.},

Such mechanisms can lead to increases of output and productivity and create firm-level benefits beyond the direct transport user benefits considered in traditional project evaluation. Transport project evaluation and transport policy more in general require an understanding of these micro-level transmission mechanisms to correctly guide investment decisions regarding the location and type of future transport projects.},

An urban problematic is identified by reference to the essential characteristics of cities as spatially polarized ensembles of human activity marked by high levels of internal symbiosis. The roots of the crisis of the classical industrial metropolis of the twentieth century are pinpointed, and the emergence of a new kind of urban economic dynamic over the 1980s and 1990s is discussed. I argue that this new dynamic is based in high degree upon the growth and spread of cognitive-cultural production systems. Along with these developments have come radical transformations of urban space and social life, as well as major efforts on the part of many cities to assert a role for themselves as national and international cultural centers. This argument is the basis of what we might call the resurgent metropolis hypothesis. The effects of globalization are shown to play a critical role in the genesis and geography of urban resurgence. Three major policy dilemmas of resurgent cities are highlighted, namely, their internal institutional fragmentation, their increasing character as economic agents on the world stage and the concomitant importance of collective approaches to the construction of localized competitive advantage, and their deepening social disintegration and segmentation.

This article provides a historical overview of all the urban plans that have made the Curitiba paradigm possible. It also recounts Curitiba's urban development and planning history through the voices of some of the people who contributed to making it the city that it is today. In addition to archival research, a series of interviews reveals their stories and memories of the experience of planning a city to be the best it can be. Their commentary on Curitiba's future suggests the work is not done. The article concludes with an appraisal of sustainability within the Curitiba context.},

  abstract = {The need for an effective form of territorial governance and spatial planning to overcome sectoral and spatial insularity has been recognized by initiatives at a variety of spatial scales. However, in an increasingly interconnected world it is difficult to determine ideal `functional' or natural `regions' which enable spatial development trends and dynamics to be fully `captured' by territorially bounded regional governance institutions. Indeed, for Schmitt-Egner (2002) the key spatial characteristic of `region' is that it is a partial spatial entity characterized by vertical and horizontal linkages with other regions and other spatial scales. Reflecting this, the article considers the treatment of cross-boundary issues in the context of emerging sub-national planning in England. Key issues addressed are: what kinds of cross-boundary issues are identified at different scales? How are cross-boundary issues recognized and responded to in the regional planning process? What are the factors which contribute to building the capacity of the regional planning process to act in relation to cross-boundary issues? The review of regional planning processes across the English regions indicates that cross-boundary issues are recognized and responded to at three spatial scales, the transnational (including inter-regional), national (including inter-regional), and sub-regional (inter- and intra-regional). A more detailed consideration of the North West region of England demonstrates that a capacity to act in relation to cross-boundary issues is being built within the process of strategic regional spatial planning through the mobilization of networks of actors at the intra- and inter-regional levels.},

  abstract = {Metropolitan planning organizations typically undertake an analysis of regional transportation plan equity to comply with federal anti-discrimination law, most prominently Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. In this critical review, we examine the law, regulatory guidance, academic research, and agency practice pertinent to equity analysis. We find that recommendations are extensive but generally lack specificity and are rarely enforceable. In the absence of detailed guidance, practice has become dominated by a single method that has foundations in the spatial analysis of environmental exposures and the neighborhood effects literature. We argue that this method is not appropriate for the analysis of transportation investment benefits, in part because target populations must be defined a priori based on demographic thresholds for areal units rather than on the basis of exposure. Further, it does not represent the travel behavior of Title VI-protected populations adequately, most notably people of color. Newer travel demand modeling paradigms are capable of sidestepping methodological problems, and legacy models can be adapted and improved. However, agencies generally have not shifted from traditional methods and planners do not view race as a variable relevant to travel behavior. By relying on an analytical technique that is not likely to reflect the travel behavior of people of color, planning agencies reduce the likelihood that racially disparate outcomes will be identified and mitigated. Meaningful transportation equity analyses must include an assessment of both current and near-term conditions and provide racially specific outcomes, while seeking to mitigate inequities through programming decisions.},

  abstract = {There is a large consensus among social researchers on the positive role that human capital plays in economic performances. The standard way to measure the human capital endowment is to consider the educational attainments of the resident population, usually the share of people with a university degree. Florida (2002) suggested a different measure of human capital\textemdash{}the ``creative class''\textemdash{}based on the actual occupations of individuals in specific jobs like science, engineering, the arts, culture, and entertainment. However, the empirical analyses conducted so far have overlooked a serious measurement problem concerning the clear definition of the education and creativity components of human capital. This article aims to disentangle this issue by proposing a disaggregation of human capital into three nonoverlapping categories: creative graduates, bohemians, and noncreative graduates. Using a spatial error model to account for spatial dependence, we assess the concurrent effect of the human capital indicators on total factor productivity for 257 regions of EU27. Our results indicate that highly educated people working in creative occupations are the most relevant component in explaining production efficiency, noncreative graduates exhibit a lower impact, and bohemians do not show a significant effect on regional performance. Moreover, a significant influence is exerted by technological capital, cultural diversity, and industrial and geographic characteristics, thus providing robust evidence that a highly educated, innovative, open, and culturally diverse environment is becoming more central for productivity enhancements.},

Since 2000 there has been an unprecedented and extremely rapid expansion in the property market, with prices booming for settlements in scenic locations, especially along the coast. This paper reports on a study of six coastal settlements in New Zealand, all of which have experienced this property boom. It found that many of the characteristics of gentrification are becoming increasingly apparent in coastal New Zealand, with particularly negative ramifications for certain parts of the community, namely indigenous communities and low income rental residents, though for many residents, the experience has been largely positive. Planning has so far failed to engage with the gentrification process or to recognise its implications for the wider coastal user community. The paper explores the contradictions associated with the gentrification process. It argues that the future of these communities needs to be wrested back from the dictates of the property market by implementing community-based planning, supported by local government.},

These trends raise the question of whether the public sector should more proactively shape urban form. Rural sprawl accounts for much of the land now being urbanized, representing a new planning challenge. The Portland Urban Growth Boundary is found to be effective at limiting this type of development. The New Urbanist neighborhood form is still extremely rare.},

Multivariate analysis reveals that car travel demand in the USA is more responsive to price than in Germany. Results suggest Americans may more easily reduce driving when faced with increasing gasoline prices. Low costs of driving in the USA may contribute to more discretionary driving, whereas higher costs of car travel in Germany may have already encouraged prudent car use.},

Between 1915, when he arrived in St. Louis, and 1950, when he retired from civil service to run his private firm, Bartholomew cultivated a professional practice through activities of widely varied scope. He grounded these activities in an urban knowledge system that disciplined the ways in which planning interventions were imagined, organized, and implemented. At the core of this system was a conception of the city as an amalgam of parts, the functions of which could be studied through the derivation of land use ratios. Using St. Louis as a laboratory, Bartholomew assembled a vision of the city and a planning methodology that paved the way for dramatic urban reconstruction after World War II.},

  abstract = {The difficulty of assembling sites large enough to redevelop at higher density can impede regeneration in city centers and accelerate suburban sprawl onto large sites already in single ownership. One promising new planning strategy to encourage voluntary land assembly is graduated density zoning, which allows higher density on larger sites. This strategy can increase the incentive for owners to cooperate in a land assembly that creates higher land values. Graduated density zoning will not eliminate the incentive to hold out, but it can create a new fear of being left out. Holdouts who are left with sites that cannot be combined with enough contiguous properties to trigger higher density lose a valuable economic opportunity. This article examines the difficulty of assembling land for infill development, and explains graduated density zoning as a way to encourage voluntary land assembly. Finally, it presents the results of graduated density zoning in practice.},

Penn Center clearly demonstrated that local planners lacked the political, legal, and financial tools to control urban redevelopment projects implemented by private actors. Such constraints help to explain why even housing-oriented liberal officials such as those in Philadelphia supported the broadening of federal urban redevelopment legislation beyond its original ``primarily residential'' orientation.},

Contrary to analyses based on the 1990 and 2000 censuses, this research finds that inner-ring suburban poverty increased from 1989 through 1997 but then declined and stabilized at levels similar to those of 1989. It will be shown that most of these changes were driven by transitions into and out of poverty, and that the migration of the poor between central-city and suburban neighborhoods has little effect on poverty rates. These results suggest that such poverty is highly dependent upon economic conditions, which may indicate an increase in inner-ring poverty since 2005.},

Federal highway policy changes during the 1960s and early 1970s gave freeway opponents opportunities to challenge controversial highways. However, decentralized metropolitan growth encouraged Huntsville leaders and city planners to support construction of the new urban expressway. Despite concerns about environmental damage and racial impacts, Huntsville's freeway revolt faltered. Further, this article argues that, despite Huntsville's late addition to the Interstate System, the local highway planning process mirrored the earlier national vision of expressway-driven redevelopment of declining central cities.},

Walking and biking emerge as prominent forms of physical activity and occur primarily in neighborhood streets and public facilities, suggesting that building walkable and bikable communities can address health as well as transportation concerns. The studies help advance environment-behavior research related to urban and transportation planning. They identify behavioral and environmental determinants of physical activity and employ rigorous data collection methods and theoretical frameworks that are new to the planning field.

It is argued that the TSI is increasingly playing a systemic, macroregulatory role in the US labour market, where it now accounts for a disproportionate share of the costs of labour-market adjustment. The development path of the TSI is closely intertwined with the wider restructuring of the US economy, where it has assumed a significant presence as a purveyor of low-cost, flexibly mediated labour.},

  abstract = {The modern growth management movement in the United States solidly emerged with the 1972 decision of the New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, in Golden v. Planning Board of Town of Ramapo. Here, the court upheld a phased development timing ordinance in which the approval of a special permit for residential development was linked to the provision of public infrastructure in accordance with an 18-year capital improvement program. This article examines how the Ramapo officials proceeded, the circumstances in which they operated, the resulting litigation, and the aftermath. It contends that, despite its influence on planning law and practice, the Ramapo system still had significant problems as an instrument of modern planning policy, creating a sprawling development pattern that is often viewed as exclusionary in places with few development options.},

In commentaries from the perspectives of planning academics and practitioners from different parts of the world, the discussion is enlarged to link the spatial planning discussions to the management literature on strategic planning, to stress the well-established process emphasis in much contemporary strategic spatial planning work, to raise some positive roles for formal plans in planning processes and to highlight recent European experiences in strategic spatial planning.},

These schools have been around just as long as their bucolic not-for-profit counterparts, yet shockingly little is known about why they have expanded so rapidly in recent years\textemdash{}during the so-called Wall Street era of for-profit colleges.In Lower Ed Tressie McMillan Cottom\textemdash{}a bold and rising public scholar, herself once a recruiter at two for-profit colleges\textemdash{}expertly parses the fraught dynamics of this big-money industry to show precisely how it is part and parcel of the growing inequality plaguing the country today. McMillan Cottom discloses the shrewd recruitment and marketing strategies that these schools deploy and explains how, despite the well-documented predatory practices of some and the campus closings of others, ending for-profit colleges won't end the vulnerabilities that made them the fastest growing sector of higher education at the turn of the twenty-first century. And she doesn't stop there.With sharp insight and deliberate acumen, McMillan Cottom delivers a comprehensive view of postsecondary for-profit education by illuminating the experiences of the everyday people behind the shareholder earnings, congressional battles, and student debt disasters. The relatable human stories in Lower Ed\textemdash{}from mothers struggling to pay for beauty school to working class guys seeking ``good jobs'' to accomplished professionals pursuing doctoral degrees\textemdash{}illustrate that the growth of for-profit colleges is inextricably linked to larger questions of race, gender, work, and the promise of opportunity in America.Drawing on more than one hundred interviews with students, employees, executives, and activists, Lower Ed tells the story of the benefits, pitfalls, and real costs of a for-profit education. It is a story about broken social contracts; about education transforming from a public interest to a private gain; and about all Americans and the challenges we face in our divided, unequal society.},

Exhibitions showcasing theoretical and practical proposals proved a popular medium for securing that consensus. Of interest here are two travelling exhibitions spreading the message of modern Anglo-American town planning knowledge globally that were staged by the British Council and the US Office of War Information (OWI). These parallel activities represent an early intersection between planning and the geopolitics of ``soft-power'', which harnessed information and culture for the purposes of international diplomacy and influence. Developed from Australian case studies, this paper shows how the parallel marketing of American site planning and housing alongside British town and country planning helped make a general case for town planning in the post-war world to be adapted to local contexts.},

The article presents innovative methods for integrating data on these indicators into a geographic information system to produce a Cultural Asset Index that can be used to identify census block groups with the highest density of these assets. The article then demonstrates the association between the concentration of cultural assets in Philadelphia in 1997 with improved housing market conditions between 2001 and 2006.

Here, New Urbanists have been involved in community-based, inner-city revitalization efforts for more than two decades. This is often overlooked in a critical literature that focuses only on New Urbanist communities in the suburbs.

This review of over 240 references presents a current view of rural planning at this opportune time to propel the field to new heights. After summarizing literature statistics, the review synthesizes the rural planning perspective, knowledge from ``rural studies,'' and the practices of rural planning and development, and makes recommendations for the planning profession. Key findings include the diversity and dynamics of rural areas, advantages, and challenges of rural planning, cutting-edge techniques and designs, and the relationship with institutions.},

  abstract = {Revitalizing America's inner cities requires an economic strategy to build viable businesses that can provide sorely needed, nearby employment opportunities. Economic development in inner cities will come only from recognizing the potential advantages of an inner-city location and building on the base of existing companies, while dealing frontally with the present disadvantages of inner cities as business locations. The economic potential in inner cities has been largely unrecognized and untapped. The private sector, which must play a central role in inner-city economic development, is just beginning to recognize this potential and has already begun investing. By improving perceptions and tackling long-neglected problems in the inner-city business environment, this trend can be accelerated. Government and community-based organizations have continuing, vital roles, but their efforts must be refocused from direct intervention to preparing and training the inner-city workforce and creating a favorable environment for business.},

Each area of inquiry has much to offer the other, yet few links have been made between them. Typically, literature on place attachment focuses on individual feelings and experiences and has not placed these bonds in the larger, sociopolitical context in which planners operate. Conversely, the community planning literature emphasizes participation and empowerment, but overlooks emotional connections to place. Yet these attachments can motivate cooperative efforts to improve one's community. Literature across disciplines is examined and synthesized to develop a framework for understanding the psychological dimensions of people's interactions with community. An ecological model is then proposed that integrates multiple environmental domains and analysis levels. This model can accommodate place attachments and meaning as well as social and political aspects of community participation.},

Feminist scholarship and travel behavior research, however, show that the travel patterns of low-income single mothers are not consistent with this behavior, resulting in a policy mismatch between many welfare recipients and their transportation needs. The research reviewed in this article indicates that policymakers and planners should do more to address the transportation needs of these low-income women. Policies must account for the important role of gender in determining where welfare recipients will look for work, how they are likely to conduct their job searches, and the mode by which they travel to both employment and household-supporting destinations.},

Whether via attempts to develop effective and socially just climate policies at multiple scales of governance [including REDD (reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation) schemes], or to develop proliferating and controversial neoliberal instruments for dealing with undesirable environmental change, environmental governance, and environmental change in the context of contemporary global capitalism are on the agenda. What would a critical and normative green political economy for the current moment look like? This paper draws on Karl Polanyi's The Great Transformation as a resource for answering that question. In particular, Polanyi's discussion of problematic and dualistic notions of nature and society in early political economy and the role he accords social struggles over land in developing his theory of fictitious commodities, embeddedness and the double movement are revisited. The paper stresses how Polanyi's ideas, at once conceptual and polemical, draw centrally on Marx's theorization of primitive accumulation as an inherent, `extra-economic' facet of historical\textendash{}geographical capitalism, a differentiated unity linking the commodification and objectification of human and nonhuman natures as exchange-values. In this respect, Polanyi offers (or seems to offer) a potential reconciliation of a politics of nonhuman and human nature through his emphasis on primitive accumulation as a site of both political struggle and epistemic transformation.

An overwhelming focus of adaptation strategies to reduce climate change-related hazards has been on hard-engineering structures such as sea walls, irrigation infrastructure and dams. Closer attention to a broader spectrum of adaptation options is urgently needed. In particular, ecosystem-based adaptation approaches provide flexible, cost-effective and broadly applicable alternatives for buffering the impacts of climate change, while overcoming many drawbacks of hard infrastructure. As such, they are a critical tool at adaptation planners' disposal for tackling the threats that climate change poses to peoples' lives and livelihoods.},

Next, it traces the three major types of spatial data problems confronting demographers: the geocoding and geoprocessing of microdata, estimation of detailed population surfaces, and combining data aggregated to incompatible zone systems. GIS and non-GIS solutions to these problems are contrasted, with examples from published research. Spatially pre-processed datasets available to demographers are then discussed. The author concludes by noting that the solutions GIS provides to previously intractable data problems in spatial demography might encourage a focus on dynamic processes of population change in local areas.},

Further research is needed to address several gaps and inconsistencies across studies and to build on recent methodological developments. Despite the limitations of existing research, it is evident that urban form can either serve to constrain or promote physical activity. Urban form interventions have the potential to result in lasting influences on the behavior of large populations of youth.},

As evidence, this article frames three aspects of Olmsted's work within contemporary green infrastructure theory and practice: ecosystem services and human well-being; environmental restoration; and comprehensive planning. The article then addresses Olmsted's philosophy regarding the civilizing influence of urbanism and concludes that green infrastructure may be integral to the evolution of the twenty-first century city.},

Most accounts attribute this to the city's dramatic natural setting, which fostered an early and insistent aesthetic critique. This article identifies the critical condition in not the city but the state. In 1947, the California legislature reoriented its entire highway program from multipurpose roads to limited-access freeways designed to go directly into cities. Resituating the revolt in this context explains not just its precocity but its duration and intensity. What began as a reasonable assertion of local jurisdiction was transformed into a protracted standoff with the state by the vast new funding of the Interstate and Defense Highway Act of 1956. It also reveals how close the city came to losing the revolt, despite the legitimacy of its claims, and identifies a direct impact of this narrow victory on the emerging environmental movement.},

Agglomeration economies and human capital spillovers suggest that such policies could enhance welfare. However, the mere existence of agglomeration externalities does not indicate which places should be subsidized. Without a better understanding of nonlinearities in these externalities, any government spatial policy is as likely to reduce as to increase welfare. Transportation spending has historically done much to make or break particular places, but current transportation spending subsidizes low-income, low-density places where agglomeration effects are likely to be weakest. Most large-scale place-oriented policies have had little discernable impact. Some targeted policies such as Empowerment Zones seem to have an effect but are expensive relative to their achievements. The greatest promise for a national place-based policy lies in impeding the tendency of highly productive areas to restrict their own growth through restrictions on land use.},

This study examines these feedback relationships with the help of a path model applied to spatially disaggregated data from Phoenix, Arizona. The empirical evidence from the observations in Phoenix suggests the following: (1) impervious surfaces contribute to increased residential water use by exacerbating UHI; (2) larger lots containing pools and mesic vegetation increase water demand by reducing diurnal temperature difference; and (3) smart design of urban environments needs to go beyond simplistic water body- and vegetation-based solutions for mitigating uncomfortably high temperatures and consider interactions between surface materials, land use, UHI, and water use.},

  abstract = {With the huge influx of immigrants into the United States in recent years, considerable efforts have been devoted to describing the extent and variation of labour market concentration across ethnic groups within or between regions. However, there is no consensus among social scientists on how to measure and identify ethnic labour market concentration patterns. The issues mainly include, firstly, how to define an employment sector\textemdash{}as an industrial or an occupational sector; secondly, how to break down employment categories; and thirdly the extent to which a job sector can be identified as an ethnic-concentrated sector, that is, what index and what threshold value should be used to define a `niche' sector? Using the case of Chinese in the San Francisco Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area, this paper demonstrates how different choices could encourage different evaluation and understanding of multi-ethnic urban labour market segmentation processes.},

Despite a decade of methodological advances regarding the importance of spatial autocorrelation in altering or reducing the reliability of regression estimates, few forecasters have tried to include such spatial relationships in their neighborhood-level projections. Part of the reason is that controlling for spatial autocorrelation is complex and can require expensive software. The authors use a free and user-friendly software package to estimate spatial effects in forecasting and then show how to develop and utilize proxy variables that can mitigate such autocorrelation. They illustrate how the failure to include such controls in Southern California could lead to overestimates of income in poor areas and hence a tendency to underserve needy areas.},

Arguably this imminent, global counterculture represents a dynamic synthesis of Eastern and Western versions of an image of utopia as the ideal decentralized community, based on cooperation and in harmony with nature. The formation of this syncretic set of Eastern and Western social-aesthetic ideals coincides with the participatory line of planning thought. It examines these ideas by tracing their origins, transmission, and transformation along lines that become increasingly interconnected with the rise of a global system leading to the emergence of modernism in the West by World War I and the formation of a global consensus on the concept of sustainable development in the 1970s and 1980s. The formation, transmission, and transformation processes involved leading Western and Eastern intellectuals whose ideas on community planning evidenced strong influences from Asia (and Japan in particular).},

Second, resilience thinking encourages planners to keep options open across sectors and scales. Finally, resilience concepts can assist planners as they make decisions with limited knowledge.},

The current policy solution is to increase driver testing, provide senior-oriented paratransit services, and ultimately, to house older, nondriving adults in senior care communities where more mobile individuals can provide basic household-related services for them. These practices, while perhaps well intentioned, effectively segregate older adults from the larger community. We can do better. This article summarizes the available literature on the travel-related needs, abilities, and preferences of older adults. Through a synthesis of the current knowledge, it identifies four strategies that can be used to design communities and transportation systems to address the safety and mobility needs of an aging population in an inclusive, universal manner.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the prevalence of Silicon Valley-style localizations of individual manufacturing industries in the United States. Several models in which firms choose locations by throwing darts at a map are used to test whether the degree of localization is greater than would be expected to arise randomly and to motivate a new index of geographic concentration. The proposed index controls for differences in the size distribution of plants and for differences in the size of the geographic areas for which data is available. As a consequence, comparisons of the degree of geographic concentration across industries can be made with more confidence. We reaffirm previous observations in finding that almost all industries are localized, although the degree of localization appears to be slight in about half of the industries in our sample. We explore the nature of agglomerative forces in describing patterns of concentration, the geographic scope of localization, and the extent to which agglomerations involve plants in similar as opposed to identical industries.},

Damaging flood events are also influenced by the way society plans for and physically develops its communities, influencing where structures and impervious surfaces are concentrated and how hydrological systems are altered. We analyze 383 nonhurricane flood events in Florida counties between 1997 and 2001 to isolate how planning decisions and their effects on the built environment affect property damage caused by floods. Our results suggest that alteration of naturally occurring wetlands significantly increases the property damage caused by floods, all else equal. Also, nonstructural methods such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Community Rating System, while providing inexpensive means of reducing property damage directly, may also indirectly encourage more development in hazardous areas.},

This article addresses the need to test the effectiveness of environmental planning and plan implementation by examining the spatial pattern of wetland development permits over a 10-year period in Florida. Specifically, our study compares the original land use design of comprehensive plans with subsequent development activity. We identity significant clusters of permits granted for wetland development and evaluate those locations against the adopted future land use maps for all county and city jurisdictions across the state. Findings indicate that development patterns that significantly deviate from the original intent of the adopted plans tend to occur in specific locations and under certain conditions. In addition, plans containing specific environmental and plan implementation policies are correlated with a greater degree of plan implementation. Based on the results, we discuss policy implications for improving plan performance at the local level and establishing a stronger link between plan content and plan implementation.},

  abstract = {Summary 
In this study we analyzed the response of monthly runoff to precedent climatic conditions at temporal scales of 1\textendash{}48 months in 88 catchments of the Ebro basin (northeast Spain). The standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) was used to summarize the climatic conditions at different time scales, and was correlated with the standardized streamflow index (SSI) calculated at the mouth of each catchment. The Ebro basin encompasses a gradient from Atlantic to Mediterranean climates, and has remarkable complexity in topography, geology and land cover. The basin is highly regulated by dams, which were built to produce hydropower and supply water for agriculture. These characteristics explain why sub-basins of the Ebro River basin respond in differing ways to precedent climatic conditions. Three main sub-basin groups were distinguished on the basis of the correlation of their streamflow responses to different time scales of the SPEI: (1) sub-basins correlated with short SPEI time scales (2\textendash{}4 months), which generally corresponded to unregulated headwater areas; (2) sub-basins correlated with long SPEI time scales (10\textendash{}20 months), where groundwater reserves play a major hydrological role; and (3) sub-basins correlated with medium SPEI time scales (6\textendash{}10 months). The latter occur in the lower sectors of the Ebro basin and its tributaries, which receive river flows from the other two sub-basins, and where dam regulation has a significant influence on the hydrological characteristics. In addition to the three main sub-basin groups, other streamflow responses associated with seasonal factors were identified, particularly those related to snowpack and the various management strategies applied to reservoirs.},

Purpose: I aim to identify strategies to increase transparency and accountability in large infrastructure projects delivered through public/private partnerships. Methods: I studied the case of an award winning public/private partnership to plan a rapid rail line in Vancouver by comparing confidential documents released after project approval to the information available while planning was underway. Results and conclusions: I find that although this project followed many best practices for achieving accountable and transparent public/private partnerships, in some instances it kept unfavorable study results from public view, limiting the potential for meaningful public involvement in the planning process. Takeaway for practice: I identify the following strategies to increase transparency and accountability in large infrastructure projects, including those delivered through private-public partnerships: (1) using a clear and narrow standard for what information should be kept confidential; (2) ensuring that public officials with responsibility for project decisions and their staffs have full access to all project information, including that not made public; (3) appointing a watchdog to see that these standards are upheld; and (4) implementing a decision process that allows public input and places the burden for proving that information should remain confidential on the entity making the request.},

It portrays them as fluid social constructs that adapt according to the relative costs of organizing the transactions that constitute a planning service. The focus is on the way organizational and institutional structures influence and are determined by post-contractual hazards. Post-contractual hazards are risks to the desired outcome of a transaction (for example the risk that a commissioned plan proves to be unworkable or irrelevant). Attention is specifically drawn to probity hazard (following economist Oliver Williamson, 1999). A set of core planning functions (transactions) are examined with the purpose of discovering if there are a priori arguments for retaining certain parts of a planning system within the public bureaucracy.},

Instead, the article argues for the importance of strong income growth in the late 1990s, not least because it was associated with an increase in non-work vehicle miles traveled; these affect commuting times because many non-work trips take place in peak hours.},

  abstract = {The concept of territoriality and its relationship to the focus and substance of spatial planning is the subject of much interest at the present time and this paper seeks to contribute to the debate by stepping into the sea. The first part of the paper establishes a framework for considering the spatial planning implications of changing conceptions of territoriality, outlining key sources of territorial innovation and their implications in terms of the development of new units and styles of governance, new challenges for planning practice, and the potential for feedback informing the development of planning theory. The application of the framework is then illustrated in the second part of the paper with reference to the emerging field of maritime spatial planning and in particular to the pioneering work that is being undertaken in Europe. This work is testing established notions of territoriality by highlighting the strong and growing connections between the land and the sea. Here some of the key implications for future spatial planning practice are identified. These indicate that there is a growing recognition of the need for innovation in the territorial units of governance in maritime regions and in the themes, processes and methods of spatial planning in these areas. The paper concludes with some observations on the implications of these findings for the theory of spatial planning.},

Using data from a survey of residents of eight neighborhoods in Northern California, this article presents new evidence on the possibility of a causal relationship between the built environment and walking behavior. This work improves on most previous studies by incorporating travel attitudes and neighborhood preferences into the analysis of walking behavior, and by using a quasi-longitudinal design to test the relationship between changes in the built environment and changes in walking. Both analyses show that the built environment has an impact on walking behavior even after accounting for attitudes and preferences.},

This study begins to address the instrument's construct validity by submitting a single, first-time freshman cohort's NSSE responses to a confirmatory factor analysis, and proposes as an alternative, eight ``dimensions'' of student engagement that fit this set of data slightly better and in a more useful way. Results have practical implications for institutions utilizing NSSE, but also contain conceptual implications pertaining to the application of these benchmarks.},

The JARC program funds state and regional transportation agencies to provide transit services to low-wage workers. The evidence suggests that the devolution of federal transportation authority has helped to create new and innovative transportation services targeted to low-wage workers. However, the program's weaknesses offer potential strategies for strengthening the benefits of devolution such as ensuring the reliability of federal funds, flexibility in the use of these funds, and greater program accountability.},

Participation structures and processes include organisation, representation, consultation and legal-administrative channels; actions include information exchange and alternative planning. A pilot application of this model framed a case study of public participation in Israel, where objections and appeals are the main channel for public involvement, giving participation an adversarial connotation. Based on the case study, proposals are made for changes to Israeli legislation, practices, and public awareness.

  abstract = {Concern over the threat to wetlands from urban development has increased with rising levels of suburbanization. This article provides an extensive overview of the literature on the history and structure of U.S. wetland conservation policy. The authors focus on regulations that permit wetland destruction in return for mitigation of wetland damage and highlight concerns that current wetland mitigation policies may lead to the redistribution of wetland benefits among specific population groups. Researchers and planners have yet to construct systems that enable them to answer a very basic question : Does wetland mitigation contribute to social disparity and inequity? The authors outline a data collection framework for use in determining if and how social disparities may occur during mitigation. They also discuss the use of spatial and temporal preference measures as a tool for addressing these considerations. Finally, they discuss how recent Supreme Court limitations on federal jurisdiction over wetlands may alter the roles and responsibilities of planners, arguing that these new roles may provide the opportunity for planners to fully incorporate social considerations into mitigation decisions.},

  abstract = {Out of the ashes of the Ottoman Empire and at the end of a protracted war of independence that followed close on the heels of the First World War, the Republic of Turkey came into being in 1923. Its founders\textemdash{}a group of career military officers led by Mustafa Kemal Atat{\"u}rk\textemdash{}set into motion in rapid order a number of societal reforms aimed at building a modernized and Westernized nation-state. Part of the founders' vision was to build the country's new capital closer to the center of its landmass. The location of choice was Ankara in the country's rural interior, and it carried a political message of major proportions. Its implementation, and the visual development of Ankara from the ground up as a major city and cultural center, was another matter. Since the statement needed to be articulated in a modern, or Western, design, Ottoman-Turkish architects were not considered for most of the jobs and, moreover, they were too few for the rapid expansion of Ankara as well as Istanbul. So Turkey assembled a group of top-of-the-line, mostly Austrian and German, talent. While doing this, planning was used as a tool for creating a capital for independence. Using archival documents, this article recounts and illustrates the physical creation of Turkey's capital city, the emergence of new visions, and the foreign actors of the built environment in the early republican process.},

It attempts to portray, classify and understand the emerging landscapes in terms of land use patterns, urban morphology and density. It is argued that the locational trends of flourishing post-industrial economic activities, along with the development of new urban governance strategies, tend to rearrange the landscapes of the post-modern city. The inner city is dominated by an eclectic clustering of economic activities: high level financial services, technology-intensive firms and knowledge-based institutions, and `creative' urban islands and edges. Such creative islands and edges constitute `signifying epicentres' which usually introduce a `glocalised' landscape of built heritage and innovative design of buildings and public open spaces. Compact and dense landscapes in the inner city are combined with new landscapes of `diffused urbanity' in urban fringes.},

Comparing residential rehabilitation activity in a sample of New Jersey jurisdictions with that in a sample of jurisdictions in nearby states without smart codes reveals that the subcode has increased the number of housing units rehabilitated, but not the aggregate value of rehabilitation activity. Localities enhance the positive effects of the New Jersey rehabilitation subcode when they allow building inspectors to use their discretion to remove additional barriers to rehabilitation that are difficult to foresee in a uniform state code.},

First, an adaptive stated preference survey is used to measure how much travel time individuals are willing to spend to obtain particular features of on- and off-street bicycle facilities. These findings indicate that bicycle commuters in Minneapolis and St. Paul prefer bicycle lanes on existing streets over off-street bicycle trails, and also prefer them over streets that have no onstreet parking but lack designated bicycle lanes. Second, I used home sales data to learn the effect of bicycle trail proximity on home value. Though proximity to bicycle facilities is valued differently for different types, it actually significantly reduced home value in suburban locations. Suburban home values were most reduced by proximity to roadside trails, which also reduced home values significantly in the cities. Proximity to other types of bicycle facilities in the cities did not significantly affect home values.},

  abstract = {A consistent finding from recent work on the evaluation of planning outcomes has been that local commitment to planning plays a vital role in explaining those outcomes, especially when planning is promoted as a way to address regional development management concerns. While the importance of local commitment is not surprising, many questions remain, such as what ``local commitment'' means, what motivates it, and how it operates to affect local planning efforts and outcomes. This article presents results from a study of state-mandated local planning in coastal North Carolina during the mid-1990s, focusing on the factors that appear to motivate local elected officials' commitment to planning and the influence of their commitment on planning outcomes. Taken altogether, coastal localities generally failed to address coastal resource protection through their local planning beyond complying with minimum state resource protection rules. This was largely because of resistance to the imposition of state-level policies through local planning requirements. State mandates appeared to foster local commitment to planning but not the state's development management goals. Within that context, local elected officials' commitment to planning played an important role in enhancing both plan quality and plan implementation.},

Two rival projects were put forward, each one focusing on a different aspect of the problem: town-planning on the one hand, transport on the other. The present article looks at the decision-making process, and the accompanying techno-political controversies. This form of analysis makes it possible to understand the different actors' viewpoints, and to make sense of their ``policy statements''. Our primary concern is to show how the decision-making process in question depended on the different protagonists' ability to provide convincing arguments, transforming the tramway issue into a problem solving exercise.},

I focus on two key areas of Du Bois's urban theory: (1) racial stratification as a fundamental feature of the modern city and (2) urbanization and urban migration. While The Philadelphia Negro has gained recent praise for Du Bois's methodological achievements, I use extensive passages from the work to demonstrate the theoretical importance of The Philadelphia Negro and to argue that this groundbreaking work should be considered canonical urban theory.},

This article uses a stated-choice experiment to determine residents' attitudes toward these various aspects of smart growth in the Salt Lake region of Utah. Utah is a conservative state, where attitudes toward auto-oriented suburbia may be more positive than in other parts of the United States. So, one might wonder whether changing national attitudes toward smart growth, documented in several surveys, apply to residents of the Salt Lake region. In this stated-choice experiment, respondents were asked to choose between pairs of housing scenarios with different attributes and different prices. Mixed logit (random parameters logit) was used to relate individuals' choices to attributes, prices, and sociodemographic characteristics of respondents. The results show that, generally, respondents have positive attitudes toward most aspects of smart growth but still express preferences for single-family neighborhoods with free parking in their own driveways or garages. Different life cycle cohorts have different preferences. Proximity to work is more important for childless young adults. Young families with children place higher value on living in a neighborhood with only single-family homes and transit access. Retired empty nesters favor a mix of housing types over single-family housing on one-acre-plus lots. The results suggest that while residents of the Salt Lake region like suburban neighborhoods with primarily single-family houses, they would also like to have improved accessibility to amenities in the suburbs.},

We first analyze the causes of the current crisis by considering how well standard explanations hold up against relevant economic theory and important stylized facts. Some explanations turn out to hold up much better than others, especially rising oil prices, the depreciation of the U.S. dollar, biofuels demand, and some commodity-specific explanations. We then provide an appraisal of the likely macro- and microeconomic impacts of the crisis on developing countries. We observe a large gap between macro and micro factors, which, when identifying the most vulnerable countries, often point in different directions. We conclude with a brief discussion of what ought to be learned from this crisis.},

Common patterns of variation in these indices across metropolitan areas are discerned using correlation and factor analyses. We find that: (1) seven principal components best summarize the dimensions of housing and employment land uses, (2) metro areas often exhibit both high and low levels of sprawl-like patterns across the seven components, and (3) housing and employment aspects of sprawl-like patterns differ in nature. Thus, land use patterns prove multi-dimensional in both theory and practice. Exploratory analyses indicate: (1) little regional variation in land use patterns, (2) metro areas with larger populations are more dense/continuous with greater housing centrality and concentration of employment in the core, (3) older areas have higher degrees of housing concentration and employment in the core, (4) constrained areas evince greater density/continuity, and (5) inter-metropolitan variations in several dimensions of land use patterns are not well explained by population, age, growth patterns, or topographical constraints on development. Results imply that policymakers must carefully unravel which land use dimension is causing undesirable outcomes, and then devise precise policy instruments to change only this dimension.},

  abstract = {Problem: This article addresses the increasing homogeneity of urban commercial areas and the loss of local culture associated with this trend. It seeks to identify strategies that build effectively on vernacular culture as an asset in neighborhood development. Purpose: We aim to identify tools that advance the cultural preservation approach to urban economic development and to describe instances in which planners and neighborhood groups have applied these tools successfully. Methods: We completed a wide-ranging literature review to identify the characteristics of places that have employed cultural preservation approaches and conducted six case studies involving 43 interviews in five cities. Results and conclusions: Our interviews and case studies showed us that there are at least three types of anchors in neighborhoods with strong vernacular culture: 1) markets; 2) ethnic areas and heritage sites; 3) and arts-and-culture venues and districts. Although the balance between preservation and development will be different in each place, we did cull some widely applicable lessons learned while conducting our fieldwork: a) involve residents; b) find assets in local needs; c) transfer lessons rather than replicating others' work; d) create opportunities for ownership; e) if it doesn't exist, invent it; and f) balance culture and commerce. Our analysis also suggests that a neighborhood wishing to pursue a neighborhood development strategy based on vernacular culture should have at least one of the anchors listed above and strong, community-based organizations. Takeaway for practice: We argue that it is both possible and preferable to advance an urban economic development strategy based on the local cultural assets that exist in urban neighborhoods. Our research illustrates different paths that places have taken to advance this kind of strategy and provides several ways for local planners and policymakers to integrate the maintenance of vernacular culture into their larger economic development plans. Research support: Our research was supported by the Fannie Mae Foundation.},

  abstract = {This article presents an alternative way of thinking about how regional sustainability might be accomplished. It starts from the premise that metropolitan regions can be understood as self-organizing complex systems if they have certain characteristics. When observed through this framework, sustainability shifts from being an end state to being a continuing process of adaptation that maintains the system or even improves its performance through learning and innovation. This article explores these ideas by investigating four Collaborative Regional Initiatives (CRIs), voluntary networks of civic leaders in California. We compare them across six themes: fit to region, theory of change, role of research, leadership, network structure, and activity. We use these elements as a conceptual framework to tell each CRI's unique and interesting story, while at the same time comparing them along common dimensions. Drawing on complexity science, we use the stories of these CRIs to develop theory about how such networks can be designed and operated to play useful roles in advancing the sustainability of a region.},

A generation later, despite open housing laws, metropolitan communities remain highly segregated, not the least in New Jersey. A revitalization plan for Camden, where the Mount Laurel affordable housing cases were instigated, has given lip service to regionalizing the recovery effort, a challenge the Ford Foundation has picked up by supporting a number of related efforts aimed at achieving ``regional equity.'' Such efforts address the state court's support for ``sound planning,'' but resistance to integration remains, leaving the outcome of concerted investments in social justice still very much in doubt.},

We find both wide variation and some consistency in how zoning ordinances address sustainability goals, independent of city size or location in the country. Some of the identified principles and regulatory items are found in many ordinances; others appear in only a few. However, there is an inverse relationship between the age of the ordinance and the extent to which it includes sustainability principles. As ordinances are updated, it is likely that they will address more topical sustainability concerns. We study only ordinance content, not implementation; moreover, sustainability can be achieved in ways other than zoning. However, zoning ordinances that directly address sustainability in many dimensions are more likely to achieve these goals. We conclude that planners can more effectively use zoning ordinances to achieve sustainable development.Takeaway for practice: This review of zoning ordinances can alert local planners to the many ways in which zoning ordinances could be used to achieve sustainability goals and suggest how planners can assess the contribution of their zoning ordinance to the sustainable development of their communities.},

Finally, although the precise mechanisms through which subsidized housing may affect crime are less clear, it is most likely that concentrated disadvantage plays the biggest role when effects are observed, rather than the physical attributes of subsidized housing.},

The analysis also suggests that bonding and bridging are distinct forms of social capital that have some different antecedents},

The investigation showed large differences between estimates of imperviousness obtained with land use and land cover data, and propose adopting a consistent standard for the future. Different results were illustrated when watershed imperviousness is measured at a few discrete points on the drainage system. Based on the findings, it recommended that planners permit a safety margin when regulating land based on imperviousness, steer development towards highly urbanized locations and away from relatively undisturbed locations, and take advantage of methods that lessen the injurious effects of imperviousness on stream ecology.},

It is the author's argument that many New Urbanist planners suffer from what she calls historical amnesia rooted in a myopic form of nostalgia, since, as she demonstrates in the article, the plans for Democracity and Futurama contain both the closest precursors and the root of many of the problems that proponents of New Urbanism are attempting to rectify. By exploring these two historical models within the context of contemporary urban community building, the author calls for the eradication of historical amnesia in further planning for the city of the future and the development of a new model of American urbanism that appropriates nostalgia for more radical ends and grounds it in the present and its problems.},

  doi = {10.1080/01944360903192560},
  abstract = {Problem: In 1997, the State of Maryland adopted a bold new approach to growth management based on a novel instrument: priority funding areas (PFAs). PFAs contain growth by directing state spending to areas designated by local governments and reviewed by the state government. Despite widespread acclaim and subsequent imitation, little is known about whether PFAs effectively contain urban growth. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to evaluate the adoption, implementation, and performance of PFAs in Maryland in order to provide planners and policymakers with insights into their efficacy as instruments for managing growth. Methods: First, we describe the statutory definition and mandated role of PFAs in state funding. Then, we describe the process used to create PFAs, the resulting pattern of targeted growth areas, the relationship between PFAs and local comprehensive plans, and the extent to which PFAs altered state spending. Finally, we examine the effects of PFAs on residential development patterns. Results and conclusions: We find that PFAs have fallen short of expectations. The criteria used to establish PFAs produced boundary configurations that vary widely and are in many cases not ideally suited to managing urban growth. Ten years after their official designation, PFAs are not well integrated in land use decision making processes in many local jurisdictions. Finally, state agencies have not altered budgetary systems to monitor and guide the spatial allocation of funds and there is little evidence that after 10 years they have had any effect on development patterns. Takeaway for practice: Targeting state funds to promote compact growth is a conceptually sound approach to urban growth containment, as land is less likely to be developed if it is not served by public infrastructure. But, as with other planning tools, the key is effective implementation. If states want to contain growth by targeting state spending, they must change budgeting processes to ensure that funds are spent appropriately and that the level of state spending is large enough to make a difference. Research support: None.},

However, their success in penetrating the decision agenda of the EU continues to be limited. While the EUropeanisation of planning has thus stalled, thanks amongst others to EU programmes, mutual learning and thus its Europeanisation has accelerated. Based on this, the paper constructs ``business as usual'' and ``deep change'' scenarios under which, by rethinking categories basic to their trade like space and territory, planners can get involved in reconfiguring European integration.},

Cautiously applying Logan and Molotch's ``growth coalition'' concept to China, the authors assert that a ``growth machine'' has formed during China's economic decentralization processes. Despite the similarities, America's urban renewal was an ill-fated federal program in which the local government and downtown business interests cooperated to boost declining inner-cities that were competing with burgeoning suburbs. In contrast, China's redevelopment has been propelled by emerging local elites using decentralized state power to pursue fast growth in rising real estate markets. Greater insights into urban redevelopment can be gleaned through this comparative analysis.},

The main purpose of this article is to explore appeal tribunals in the field of land-use planning. This is done through an exploratory survey and reorganization of current literature. The article highlights the international prevalence of appeal tribunals, offers insight about their role, points to existing gaps in knowledge, and explores future research needs.},

(2) Who gains and who loses, and by which mechanisms of power? (3) Is this development desirable? (4) What, if anything, should we do about it? A central task of phronetic planning research is to provide concrete examples and detailed narratives of the ways in which power and values work in planning and with what consequences to whom, and to suggest how relations of power and values could be changed to work with other consequences. Insofar as planning situations become clear, they are clarified by detailed stories of who is doing what to whom. Clarifications of that kind are a principal concern for phronetic planning research and provide the main link to praxis.},

This paper quantifies the role of plant relocations in the geographic redistribution of manufacturing employment and examines the effectiveness of state development policy. Only a few studies have looked at how manufacturing firms locate their production facilities geographically; they have used either small manufacturing samples or small geographic regions. This paper provides broader evidence of the impact of plant relocations using confidential establishment level data from the US Census Longitudinal Research Database (LRD), covering the full population of manufacturing establishments in the United States over the period from 1972 to 1992. This paper finds a relatively small role for relocation in explaining the disparity of manufacturing employment growth rates across states. Moreover, it finds evidence of very weak effects of incentive programs on plant relocations.},

Yet, food planning has a long and multifaceted history. Though not theorized as food system planning in most of the secondary literature in planning history, it is not hard to find when we look, even at some of the most familiar, seminal plans and scholarship in planning history. In this article, we trace the broad continuities and major changes in North American food planning, focusing on physical planning, regional economic development, and community economic development from the age of colonization to the present. The planners of early American cities necessarily organized urban environments and metropolitan infrastructure around agriculture, and some helped to build an international food economy. Since the nineteenth century, professional planners and their grassroots counterparts have struggled to manage the challenges posed by the industrial food system and society, in which the place of agriculture in the city is more ambiguous and contested.},

In contrast, the outer-ring suburbs continued to thrive, drawing most of the new population and housing development in the context of intrametropolitan spatial differentiation. The downtowns and some parts of the inner city showed a gradual recovery from the pattern of deterioration. By recognizing the interdependence of all the subareas and applying sound, holistic policies, the public policy decision-making entities can ensure the future stability of the inner-ring suburbs as well as all the surrounding areas of a metropolitan region.},

At decade's end, regional leaders rejected two interstate freeways, repudiated a freeway-based regional transportation plan, and agreed to build the beginning of a regional rail system. In seeming contradiction to their anti-auto actions, they also lobbied Congress to change federal law so that they could spend money from deleted interstate highway projects on noninterstate roads rather than on transit. This article documents how planners and power brokers in Portland negotiated among themselves to channel the energy from what began as a citizen- and neighborhood-based revolution into the beginnings of a new consensus about transit, road, and land use development by the end of the decade, one that implicitly recognized personal preference for mass mobility but that explicitly championed designs of transportation facilities to reflect local objectives.},

  abstract = {In this paper we adjudicate between competing claims of persisting segregation and rapid integration by analyzing trends in residential dissimilarity and spatial isolation for African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians living in 287 consistently defined metropolitan areas from 1970 to 2010. On average, Black segregation and isolation have fallen steadily but still remain very high in many areas, particularly those areas historically characterized by hypersegregation. In contrast, Hispanic segregation has increased slightly but Hispanic isolation has risen substantially owing to rapid population growth. Asian segregation has changed little and remains moderate, and although Asian isolation has increased it remains at low levels compared with other groups. Whites remain quite isolated from all three minority groups in metropolitan America, despite rising diversity and some shifts toward integration from the minority viewpoint. Multivariate analyses reveal that minority segregation and spatial isolation are actively produced in some areas by restrictive density zoning regimes, large and/or rising minority percentages, lagging minority socioeconomic status, and active expressions of anti-Black and anti-Latino sentiment, especially in large metropolitan areas. Areas displaying these characteristics are either integrating very slowly (in the case of Blacks) or becoming more segregated (in the case of Hispanics), whereas those lacking these attributes are clearly moving toward integration, often quite rapidly.},

In general, offshoring to low-wage countries substitutes for domestic employment. However, for firms that do significantly different tasks at home and abroad, foreign and domestic employment are complements. These offsetting effects may be combined to show that offshoring by U.S.-based multinationals is associated with a quantitatively small decline in manufacturing employment.},

There are gated communities composed of mostly White homeowners with high incomes that have a secure main entry\textemdash{}the kind of classic gated community in the public mind. But there are also gated communities that are inhabited by minority renters with moderate incomes. We expected that this dichotomy reflects a divide between gated communities, one based on status versus one motivated by concern for security.

  abstract = {While urban disamenities and pollution sources have received considerable attention in environmental justice research, few studies have examined sociospatial inequities associated with the distribution of desirable land uses. In this paper we focus on addressing this limitation by investigating the environmental equity implications of street trees\textemdash{}an important publicly financed amenity that provides several direct and indirect benefits to urban residents. The specific objective was to determine if the spatial distribution of public right-of-way trees is equitable with respect to race and ethnicity, income, and housing tenure in the city of Tampa, Florida, USA. We seek to extend research on equity analysis of urban amenities through several methodological innovations, including: (a) accounting for the heterogeneity of urban land use; (b) utilizing high-resolution remote sensing techniques to quantify parcel-specific tree cover; and (c) using multivariate regression models that control for spatial dependence within the data. The results support the inequity hypothesis by indicating a significantly lower proportion of tree cover on public right-of-way in neighborhoods containing a higher proportion of African-Americans, low-income residents, and renters. These findings have important implications for local public investment and policy strategies.},

  doi = {10.1080/01944360801944948},
  abstract = {Problem: As Richard Florida's writings about the creative class garnered attention across the globe, planners and local government officials responded by enacting policies to attract and retain creative workers, often favoring spending for amenity and lifestyle attractions over more established economic development approaches. It is not clear, however, if the presence of these workers drives regional growth and development as effectively as more traditionally accepted place-based and institutional factors. Purpose: In this article we explore the relationships between the presence of the creative class and regional economic performance, contrasting measures of regional creative capacity with traditional competitiveness factors. Methods: We examine how Florida's creative class measures correlate with each other and with common indicators of economic performance for U.S. metropolitan areas. We also estimate multivariate regression models to compare the influence of Florida's measures to those of more traditional indicators of economic competitiveness on metropolitan job growth, income growth, and job instability. Results and conclusions: We find that differences in Florida's measures of creativity are not generally associated with differences in metropolitan economic performance. Indicators of human capital and industry composition perform as well or better than talent, tolerance, and technology in explaining metropolitan job and income growth and job instability. Takeaway for practice: Since we find measures derived from Florida's creative class hypotheses to be no more associated with positive economic outcomes than traditional competitiveness measures, we do not advocate replacing traditional economic development strategies with those based primarily on attracting the creative class. Programs supporting education, business creation, and industrial diversity are more likely to be effective tools for promoting economic well-being. Research support: We received support from the Center for the Study of the American South and the Office of Economic and Business Development's Program on Southern Politics, Media, and Public Life, both of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.},

We ask the following questions: What assumptions underlie intersectional perspectives in sociology? Is there any evidence to demonstrate that race and gender intersect in the labor market? We begin by discussing the core assumptions within Black and multiracial feminist theories, which represent the most fully articulated treatments of "intersectionality." We then broaden our theoretical overview by identifying fundamental differences in the way that sociologists conceptualize intersectionality. We look for evidence of intersectionality in three central domains of research on labor market inequality: (a) wage inequality, (b) discrimination and stereotyping, and (c) immigration and domestic labor. We find that race and gender do intersect in the labor market under certain conditions. Finally, we consider how an intersectional approach enriches labor market research and theorizing about economic inequality.},

The article argues that the process has achieved some of its aims and is a useful effort at generating awareness of, and interest in, this aspect of strategic policy making. However, the case highlighted shows how important it is to develop an appropriate collaborative process if a policy mechanism is to endure. This requires greater attention to: the purposes of participation in strategy development; the skills, practices and roles needed by the animateurs of such processes; the system of formal decision-making institutions and mechanisms arising from re-territorialisation in the UK case; and reconceptualising participatory processes in more deliberative ways. The article concludes with an assessment of ways forward both specifically for the development of strategic transport policy and for stakeholder engagement in similar exercises in other policy areas.},

  abstract = {Problem: Even if significant reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions are achieved, some amount of climate change appears to be inevitable. Local, regional, state, and federal planning and regulation should begin to address how to adapt to these changes. Purpose: This article presents a policy synthesis of adaptation planning issues, using California as a case study. We examine the institutional and regulatory challenges and tradeoffs that climate change poses in six particularly vulnerable areas: water resources, electricity, coastal resources, air quality, public health, and ecosystem resources. We discuss obstacles to adaptation planning and successes overcoming these barriers, and suggest how planning can incorporate adaptation. Methods: This article presents a policy synthesis of adaptation planning issues, drawing on our recent research on California's experience and related literature. We summarize the results of six studies that draw on quantitative and qualitative information gathered through surveys, interviews, and literature review. Results and conclusions: Planners should use forward-looking climate data that include higher water and air temperatures, sea-level rise, and increased numbers of extreme events like heat waves, floods, and wildfires when making decisions about future development, infrastructure investments, open-space protection, and disaster preparedness. Climate change will exacerbate conflicts between goals for economic development, habitat protection, and public safety, requiring stronger interagency coordination and new laws and regulations. Takeaway for practice: Local and regional planners can help society adapt to a changing climate by using the best available science, deciding on goals and early actions, locating relevant partners, identifying and eliminating regulatory barriers, and encouraging the introduction of new state mandates and guidelines. Research support: Partial support for this research was provided by Pacific Gas and Electric, The Nature Conservancy, and Next 10.},

The paper focuses on loft conversions in Clerkenwell, adjacent to the City of London which are shown to be initiated by changes in the commercial property market, particularly the rise and fall of the secondary office market and the need to find alternative uses for commercial property. The apartments have been marketed in terms of their architectural distinction, their centrality and the social attributes of city-centre living. Their residents are professional and managerial workers with a strong orientation towards centrality, many of whom see themselves as pioneers of a new form of city-centre living.},

A case study of a current planning project, where a planned high speed railway meets the centre of a medium-sized city, serves as a basis for a discussion about the commitment of the main parties to cooperate for coordinated planning. The study reveals a gap in terms of the commitment signalled to joint efforts, and thus also the expectations of their respective counterpart. Depending on the definition of commitment, both parties can be seen as highly committed, but while the railway agency has its commitment orientated primarily towards the transport system as such, i.e. the content of the cooperation, the concern of the municipality is more about commitment to the continuity of the cooperative efforts, i.e. the process of cooperating. The paper concludes by pointing at some wider implications of the analysis. In particular, the lack of a coherent spatial perspective in the national planning system, and the prospects for institutional conditions for coordination to be made more explicit, are discussed.},

In our example, we find what qualities distinguish main streets from other highways. Main street stakeholders were shown photos and video clips of state highways and asked to score them on a `main street' scale. We then estimated a cross-classified random effects model using main street scores as the dependent variable, and characteristics of scenes and viewers as independent variables. This class of models is new to the planning field and is preferred when random effects are present and an outcome varies systematically in two dimensions, as do ratings of different scenes by different viewers. The model we estimated can now be used to qualify certain highways for special treatment as main streets or to redesign certain highways to be more main street-like.},

  abstract = {In this study, we present an indexing scheme to screen large numbers of brownfield sites in wide areas (municipalities, counties, states or other types of districts) in order to develop initial planning strategies for fund allocation and redevelopment. The scheme entails three dimensions, socioeconomic, smart growth and environmental, for each of which an index is constructed on the basis of location-specific variables irrespective of the target end use. Socioeconomic variables include population density, property values and unemployment which collectively represent the potential contribution of brownfield redevelopment to economic growth. The smart growth or livability index was developed on the basis of the LEED ND evaluation scheme of the U.S. Green Building Council, isolating location-specific features. Finally, the environmental index incorporates variables that represent the potential source of contamination (past use), pathway of exposure (soil permeability) and receptors (zoning, proximity to water bodies, parks, critical habitats, open spaces, wetlands and floodplains). The application of the indices to the City of New Haven, Connecticut as a case study yielded four priority sites out of 47 in the city inventory. Even though the indices were sensitive to the chosen weights, prioritization of sites in clusters reduced the effect; the top four sites were identical in the case study and 31 out of 47 sites were present in the same cluster regardless of the weighting scheme.},

  abstract = {Since the 1980s, the American federal government has devolved a wide array of crucial policy decisions to the state and local levels. With a decrease in federal aid and an increase in the number of tools available to lower tiers of government, scholars of American urban politics have suggested that cooperation among metropolitan municipalities could help address critical local political and policy challenges. Metropolitan political polarization, however, is a serious obstacle to these partnerships, and an issue that remains poorly understood. This project thus seeks to accomplish two key goals. First, I describe and explain variations in metropolitan political polarization, proposing three potential drivers of metropolitan differences: racial composition (including both black and Hispanic demographic variables), income inequality, and institutional configurations. Second, I explore the political and policy consequences of these metropolitan variations, examining the impact of polarization on municipal political composition and mass transportation policy-making. I discover that at the metropolitan level, racial demographics - particularly whether the region has a high concentration of blacks - almost exclusively explain variations in political polarization, with more black metropolises experiencing greater polarization. These divisions, in turn, have a potent effect on local government policy: more polarized regions exhibit more politically extreme municipalities and more fragmented transit policy outcomes. These findings have a disturbing implication: those regions with concentrated pockets of black poverty - places most in need of metropolitan cooperation in the contemporary, heavily localized political climate - are the least able to forge partnerships around shared local policy goals.},

I further investigate efforts of transnationalism from ``below'' scholars by building on the idea of a ``shadow place.'' I then analyze the transnational networks that are supported by employers, the state, and immigrants, and that create exploitative transnational spaces dependent on unauthorized communities. The study offers planners a better understanding of the vulnerability, risks, and interdependence of shadow transnational networks.},

Inspired by European experiments, proponents of public housing dreamed of a decentralized housing program carried out by many entities and aimed at a majority of the population, not the very poor. Before their movement could take root locally, however, the Great Depression created political opportunities for a federal program. Lacking a grassroots constituency, public housers waged a masterful smoke-and-mirrors strategy to stir up support for public housing among nonhousing organizations and, in 1937, won a permanent program. Yet lawmakers used the housers' antislum arguments to justify including provisions to clear slums and to house the poor and then excluded funds for nongovernmental housing entities such as limited-dividend corporations and cooperatives. The public housing projects themselves would never inspire much political enthusiasm. Thus, the public housers built enough political support to create a public housing program but not to realize their dream.},

  abstract = {In response to the growing critique of decentralized and participatory approaches to development, the article develops a theoretical framework for analyzing the relationship between community-based planning and poverty. Building on contributions from research on collective action, social capital, and social movements, the framework identifies a series of variables that are theorized to affect a community's capacity to alleviate poverty. Using this framework, three community-level case studies in Oaxaca, Mexico are analyzed. All three communities are characterized by a decline in subsistence agriculture, increasing out-migration, and the use of remittances to finance community-based planning projects. The article documents each community's capacity to alleviate the material manifestations of poverty. It concludes that only the community with the strongest capacity for community-level collective action was capable of planning independent of the state, and thus in a position to take incipient steps toward addressing poverty's structural causes. The findings call into question the often assumed desirability of collaborative planning and support the need for a more nuanced understanding of the strengths and limitations of distinct forms of community-based planning interpreted within broader socio-political contexts.},

Using the land around stations for development rather than parking would allow more passengers to access the system without driving and ostensibly go much further toward reducing dependence on automobiles. However, it is unclear whether ridership levels can be maintained without a park-and-ride option. This research seeks to illuminate this issue with a demand model for the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system. Passenger counts are estimated for each origin/destination pair in the BART system based on such variables as parking spaces, housing units, and employment adjacent to stations. Parameters from this model are then used to estimate the amount of development required to replace the riders generated by station parking. Depending on the characteristics of a station and its spatial relationship with other stations, the level of development density required to effectively replace parking is found to be much higher than what is generally feasible.},

But, as shown in some New Zealand examples, much planning activity is still largely focused on the physicality of place rather than its embedded qualities. Other social science disciplines have much to offer in understanding the nature of these relationships, and in developing a range of assessment tools to evaluate them. The planning field needs to draw inspiration from other disciplinary theories, and to develop or adopt a conceptual framework that accounts for both the rational and intangible qualities of space and place. This could assist planners to ``design with culture'' as well as with nature, and to better incorporate place identity into the decision-making mix.},

Many concluded that UGBs force home prices upward. But detailed analyses of home price movements from 1980 to 2000 show that prices did not rise nearly as fast in Portland as in many other regions in the 1980s, that home prices rose faster in Portland only from 1990 to 1994 or 1996, and that home prices in several other regions without UGBs were also rising rapidly. Multiple regression analyses of 85 large metropolitan areas showed that a dummy variable measuring the effect of Portland's UGB had statistically significant effects on home prices only in the first half of the decade. So it is erroneous to conclude from Portland's experience that UGBs inevitably cause home prices to rise faster.},

  abstract = {Abstract.\hspace{0.6em} A hybrid conditional logit choice model is estimated using data on the characteristics and destination of homeowners who engaged in intrametropolitan moves among 17 school districts within the Columbus, Ohio area in 1995. The model is used to test the relative influence of local fiscal and public goods versus household-level characteristics in determining household location choices across central city and suburban school districts. Results provide evidence of both a ``natural evolution'' of households to the suburbs, due to job location, residential filtering, and household income and lifecycle effects, and ``flight from blight,'' due to lower school quality, higher crime levels, and lower average income levels in the city. In comparing the magnitudes of these variables, we find that school quality exerts the strongest influence: a 1-percent increase in the school quality of the city district increases the probability of choosing a city residence by 3.7 percent. In contrast, the effects of household income and other individual characteristics are relatively modest. The findings provide support for a ``flight from blight'' suburbanization process that is dominated by differences in neighborhood quality between the city and suburbs. An implication is that investments that promote central city development and reduce suburbanization are justified on efficiency grounds if negative externalities are generated by increased concentration of poverty, crime, and low school quality.},

In this article, we present several quantitative measures of urban form and compute these for neighborhoods of varying age in Washington County, the western portion of the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area. Our results suggest (I) neighborhoods in Washington County have increased in single-family dwelling unit density since the 1960s; (2) internal street connectivity and pedestrian access to commercial areas and bus stops have improved since the early 1990s; (3) external connectivity continues to decline; and (4) the mixing of land uses remains limited. We condude that while several measures appear to be improving, Portland's war on sprawl is not yet won.},

However, the efficient application of LR is contingent on certain basic conditions. In this article, the basic conditions are defined and examined for the successful and efficient application of the LR method within the frame of international literature. The provision of benefits expected from LR rests on the availability of LR models that include the foregoing basic conditions.},

Very little has been written about experiences in rural areas. The Environmental Studies Department at St. Lawrence University has experimented with several strategies for service learning in rural northern New York. As a type of service learning, the research seminar offers several advantages over conventional internships and community-based independent study. These advantages are critical in rural areas of sparse population, where few agencies exist. Case studies involving conservation easements, community planning, and historical preservation demonstrate that some agencies derive real benefits from service learning. The case studies also illustrate the following lessons: the research seminar can engage a variety of planning issues and organizations; it is helpful, though not necessary, if sponsoring organizations articulate needs, but they should not anticipate preferred results from research; university staff should pay close attention to the sociopolitical context of participating agencies and ensure that students are fully immersed in the community; and service learning can make tangible contributions to the quality of rural life, thereby making these areas more attractive for residents who wish to stay.},

  abstract = {At around 20 square metres per space and occupying over 30\% of the ground area of many cities, car parking is an expected but unnoticed land use - pulling the proverbial devil's trick of ``convincing the world it doesn't exist''. Recent poster slogans in Melbourne calling to ``fight the towers! Or kiss your car park goodbye'' imply that frustration over a lack or perceived future lack of parking space carries weight in planning conflicts over intensifying Australian cities. The research in this paper was motivated by a suspicion that fears expressed by existing residents about parking are a frequent and prominent but rarely examined planning issue in Victoria. The paper interprets residents' claims made about inadequate parking as conflicts over asserted rights, and their allocation and reallocation through planning. It is based on a content analysis of four months (325 cases) of published Victorian planning appeals from 2012. It is found that over half the appeals featured car parking as a significant issue, and that of these, nine out of ten involved third party objectors. The planning system is called upon to respond to issues arising from car rather than land use, and to do so by making further allowances for cars. This asserted ``folk legality'' of individual car parking rights is difficult to reconcile with growing literature offering critical perspectives on aggregate costs from ``predict and provide'' car parking policies. Differences between public and planning interpretations of the role of planning in balancing car parking rights and common good are observed. Ultimately, conflict over asserted parking rights in planning draw out fundamental tensions around who \textendash{} or what \textendash{} has the right to occupy space.},

To evaluate the nature of teaching on these issues, we conducted a survey of accredited planning degree programs. Results suggest that among accredited planning education degree programs, there is significant room for improvement in quality and quantity of teaching about voluntary land conservation. Recommendations include making some currently elective courses required and introducing more varied and participatory teaching methods in current and new courses that cover these topic areas.},

While ``just city'' and neo-pragmatist perspectives have recently theorized progressive policy and planning efforts to create viable alternatives to the dominant neoliberal urban and local economic development model, they have paid less attention to the relationship between race, urban political economy, and transformative planning. This article seeks to bridge this gap by elaborating a conception of race that incorporates W.E.B. DuBois' notion of ``double consciousness'' with neo-pragmatist planning perspectives to illuminate potential synergies between the situated perspectives of socially marginalized groups and differentially situated, resourced, and abled allies in illuminating systemic problems and directing deeper modes of urban policy and planning recourse. Drawing from two empirical cases, it examines how progressive urban coalitions might use race as a diagnostic and dialogic tool in undertaking provisional and contextual inquiry and praxis in the urban economic sphere toward realization of the ``just city.''},

Whom did the planners identify and engage as ``stakeholders'' in so many different places responding to the same national goals and requirements? We evaluate the reports and accounts of participation within the plan documents in order to compare variations in India's plan-making practice. We classify the plan-making efforts by interpreting the variation in relation to evidence about who the planners involved and using which methods, and to what extent. Grounding the investigation in the literature of post-independence spatial planning uncovers meaningful variations from the elite driven centralized planning model, including the emergent involvement of local actors. The paper concludes with an exploration of the future implications associated with this type of transformation for practice-oriented research in urban India and other developing contexts.},

The economic dynamics of these city-regions are analysed with particular emphasis on the ways in which they tend to generate increasing-returns effects and competitive advantages for local producers. The managerial tasks that these city-regions face raise many new issues about local economic development policy and institution building in the interests of social order. These issues lead on to further questions about democracy and citizenship in the global mosaic of city-regions as well as in the new world system as a whole.},

Each involved differing assumptions about knowledge, participation, and the nature of a good plan. Players using one style were often mistrustful or contemptuous of those working in others. Regional actions--as opposed to packages of projects for parochial interests--were rare. The few regional initiatives emerged from collaborative planning and social movements. We argue that where diversity and interdependence of interests are high, collaboration is the most effective approach. Key barriers to collaboration included state and federal funding formulas, earmarking, and the substantial documentation required by state and federal regulations.},

  abstract = {The Planning Inspectorate is a key institution in the English planning system which has a high public profile. It is a planning agency of the UK central government which is responsible for determining appeals against the refusal of planning permission and conditions imposed on development by local planning authorities. It also determines appeals against enforcement action on unlawful development and holds public local inquiries, where planning inspectors hear objections to policies contained in development plans. The decisions made by the Planning Inspectorate must be seen to be fair, transparent and accountable and, as a consequence, the procedures and conduct of the organisation are increasingly subject to public scrutiny. However the arena in which the Inspectorate now operates has become increasingly more complex. Significant social change has impacted on space, spatial activities and the way people use space. Campaigns around the issues of race, gender, disability, age and sexuality have challenged the notion of a homogeneous public and developed the view of a socially and culturally diverse society. As issues of diversity have become more widely recognised and expressed in society, so the UK government has expected key planning organisations, such as the Planning Inspectorate, to reflect and respond to these changes, particularly in the light of the new Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. This paper examines the initiatives undertaken to mainstream equality and manage diversity in the Planning Inspectorate. It critically reflects on the scope and effectiveness of the initiatives and identifies lessons that can be learned for other planning institutions. The material used in the paper draws heavily on three sources: consultancy work undertaken for the Planning Inspectorate; documentary analysis; and case study material and findings from a recent research project into planning and diversity},

  abstract = {The retail distribution sector is facing a difficult time as the current landscape is characterized by ever-increasing competition. In these conditions, the search for an appropriate location strategy has the potential to become a differentiating and competitive factor. Although, in theory, an increasing level of importance is placed on geography because of its key role in understanding the success of a business, this is not the case in practice. For this reason, the process outlined in this paper has been specifically developed to detect new business locations. The methodology consists of a range of analyzes with Geographical Information Systems (GISs) from a marketing point of view. This new approach is called geomarketing. First, geodemand and geocompetition are located on two separate digital maps using spatial and non-spatial databases. Second, a third map is obtained by matching this information with the demand not dealt with properly by the current commercial offer. Third, the Kernel density allows users to visualize results, thus facilitating decision-making by managers, regardless of their professional background. The advantage of this methodology is the capacity of GIS to handle large amounts of information, both spatial and non-spatial. A practical application is performed in Murcia (Spain) with 100 supermarkets and data at a city block level, which is the highest possible level of detail. This detection process can be used in any commercial distribution company, so it can be generalized and considered a global solution for retailers.},

This article aims to address these issues, and to develop a deeper understanding of both the theory and practice of integration by examining the relationship between spatial planning and health. Here, improved integration offers the potential to enhance the physical, social and mental well-being of individuals and communities. Drawing upon integration literature, Part 1 of the article establishes a framework for considering integration in spatial planning. Part 2 then explores how this framework can be used to examine current spatial planning practice with reference to work undertaken as part of the development of the new Regional Spatial Strategy for North West England. This concerned the linkage between regional spatial planning and health. The article concludes by reflecting on the value of the integration framework proposed, how it might be developed, and on some of the key practice challenges presented by the current focus on spatial planning in England and elsewhere.},

In this process of global economic convergence, Asian economies in particular have combined increasing expertise in manufacturing technology with lower labor and capital costs to "hollow out" formerly US-dominated high-tech supply chains. One result has been a steady deterioration in the US Census Bureau's "advanced technology products" trade balance (see http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c0007.html) over the past decade, which turned negative in 2002 and continued to deteriorate to a record deficit of \$100 billion in 2011, improving only slightly to a deficit of \$91 billion in 2012. The bottom line is that the United States has underinvested for several decades in a set of productivity-enhancing assets necessary for the long-term health of its manufacturing sector.},

It examines London, where the difference between the value of land for residential and industrial use, and the pressure to address the housing crisis, is leading to the rapid loss of industrial land and premises. The paper first explores the role of industry in a high-value city such as London, arguing that trends in manufacturing in advanced economies are increasing the benefit for firms of an urban location, whilst at the same time, cities continue to need industry if they are to be economically and socially resilient, sustainable and vibrant. The paper then explores current approaches to planning for industry in London, identifying impacts of a policy framework that anticipates and plans for its decline. Finally, it focuses on the question of how to plan for a productive and inclusive city: we explore the arguments in favour of integrating industry into the urban fabric as well as the benefits of separating land uses and retaining employment land designations, and reveal how urbanists are divided. We argue that if London is to continue to prosper, and meet the needs of all Londoners, then we need to strategically and proactively plan for industry in the city, to experiment with innovative ways of integrating it with other city uses, whilst protecting land for industry, where required. We put forward a critical research agenda to effectively meet this challenge in the future.},

This article examines the regulation of animal agriculture since the eighteenth century in four cities: Baltimore, Boston, Philadelphia, and New York. Across the nineteenth century, municipal ordinances to remove farm animals from city limits set the tone for the planning profession, aligning it with the field of public health in creating a hygienic city. In the efforts to untangle animal agriculture from waste management, public space, and urban food supply, urban authorities employed some of the first land-use regulations in the United States, shaping new planning powers. Ordinances banning slaughterhouses, piggeries, and dairies culminated with zoning as planning became a profession. These regulations ultimately allowed planners to transform cities and their food environments by dismantling a system in which animals and their caretakers among the urban poor had played integral parts in food production, processing, and municipal waste management. Unpacking the objectives, debates, and impacts of these early regulations reveals enduring tensions and challenges as planners today seek to reweave animal agriculture into cities.},

A variety of mitigation methods exist, several of which create or restore wetlands elsewhere to compensate for losses at the site of the original wetland impact. Critics assert that such mitigation programs relocate wetlands from urban to rural areas, causing disparities. This article analyzes 1,058 permitted wetland mitigation transactions in the Chicago region between 1993 and 2004. Our analysis shows that some wetlands are relocated from urban to rural areas, but we also find that wetlands are moved between suburban areas. Most relocated wetlands move from areas with high population densities to areas with much lower densities, though one mitigation method did not have this effect. Our analysis demonstrates that the mitigation method chosen affects whether there are significant socioeconomic differences between the area where the original wetland impact occurs and that in which the newly created or renovated wetland is located. These findings suggest that planners must take relocation and redistributive effects into account in setting up and administering mitigation programs, particularly as responsibility for wetland protection shifts from federal to local regulators.},

Drawing on case study data from two London local authorities, it finds that planning authorities are moving away from protecting employment land to actively promoting the mixed-use redevelopment of employment sites, even when there are thriving businesses on these sites and a shortage of supply of employment premises and land, relative to demand. We examine the drivers for changing policy including the national and regional policy contexts, housing targets, the influence of austerity measures, rise of Neighbourhood Planning and changing conceptions of regeneration and the role of housing therein. The article highlights the complex task faced by local planners and the tensions involved in simultaneously finding sites for housing, fostering economic development and promoting mixed-use redevelopment in planning policy and decisions. We find that changes in policy are fuelling speculation for housing development on sites occupied by viable businesses, supporting rather than responding to deindustrialization. This is leading to a gap between aspirations for delivering mixed-use environments on hitherto employment sites and realities on the ground.},

Contemporary livelihood strategies in many African cities involve participation in multiple economic activities, usually in both the formal and informal sectors. This paper proposes the ``multiple modes of livelihood'' (MML) approach as a framework for capturing this emerging livelihood strategy and presents evidence to show the magnitude of the strategy and the kind of activities undertaken. Development and planning implications of this strategy include the following: i) planning theories must reflect the changing livelihood in African cities; ii) the different geographies of such activities within and between urban areas, the proliferation of home-based enterprises in the middle- and professional-class neighborhoods, the emergence of nontraditional household arrangements, and the importance of urban agriculture suggest the need to indigenize urban planning in Africa; and iii) the proliferation of multiple livelihood strategies, especially among public sector employees, has significant implications for national development, especially as it relates to the performance of the public sector.},

This prevailing wisdom needs considerable revision. In this essay we present a theoretical interpretation of industrial suburbanization. We argue that the outward spread of factories and manu{\'I}facturing districts has been a distinctive and important feature of North American urbanization since the middle of the nineteenth century. The paper begins with a discussion of how industrial decentralization has been repeatedly misinterpreted as new and unprecedented, rather than an extension of past trends. In contrast to the prevailing interpretation, we claim that industrial suburbanization is the product of a combination of the economic logic of geographical industrialization, investment in real estate, and political guidance by business and government leaders. The result has been extensive, multinodal metropolitan regions.},

In the 1970s, Boston, New York City, and Portland, Oregon initiated such teardowns, each with a different replacement: Boston began replacing its elevated Central Artery with a system of tunnels, later known as the Big Dig; New York replaced its West Side Highway with a street-level boulevard; and Portland bulldozed its Harbor Drive to make way for a waterfront park. Now, many cities are re-evaluating past highway policy that pushed elevated interstate highways through central cities, with consequent severe damage to housing, businesses, and neighborhoods. The teardown movement is high on the agenda of the Congress for the New Urbanism, now headed by John Norquist. A former Mayor of Milwaukee, Norquist pioneered the twenty-first century expressway teardown in an effort to eliminate an unneeded eyesore and spur downtown economic development. This article surveys the debate over teardown policy in several cities. It also analyzes the movement generally, suggesting that the main thrust is to compensate for past decisions that damaged central cities, but that the movement poses no threat to the heavily used urban expressways that millions of drivers rely on every day. Many teardown advocates have also promoted greater investment in mass transit and light rail.},

We address this deficiency by assessing occupation-level effects on wage inequality using data from the Current Population Survey for 1983 through 2008. We model the mean and variance of wages for each occupation, controlling for education and demographic factors at the individual level to test three competing explanations for the increase in wage inequality: (1) the growth of between-occupation polarization, (2) changes in education and labor force composition, and (3) residual inequality unaccounted for by occupations and demographic characteristics. After correcting for a problem with imputed data that biased Kim and Sakamoto's (2008) results, we find that between-occupation changes explain 66 percent of the increase in wage inequality from 1992 to 2008, although 23 percent of this is due to the switch to the 2000 occupation codes in 2003. Sensitivity analysis reveals that 18 percent of the increase in inequality from 1983 to 2002 is due to changes in just three occupations: managers ``not elsewhere classified,'' secretaries, and computer systems analysts.},

However, it is difficult to determine the demand for alternative housing or neighborhood types that may not be available or are available only in limited quantities. Hence, the market may not accurately reveal consumer preferences for such alternatives. We estimate a discrete choice model of neighborhood choice by using data from a choice-based conjoint analysis survey that allows us to vary characteristics experimentally. The model is used to determine consumer preferences for neotraditional neighborhood design features, including neighborhood layout, housing density, surrounding open space, and commuting time, while holding other characteristics, including school quality and neighborhood safety, constant. The results indicate that the neotraditional design with higher density is less preferred on average, but that niche marketing, additional open space, or other amenities can overcome its negative effects.},

We then analyze correlations between city and suburban job growth rates and reexamine our previous research on cities in the 1990s using data from 1998 to 2001. We draw five practical lessons from this analysis. First, though central cities' recent achievements differ, economic distress persists. Second. employment growth in central cities depends on healthy regional employment growth. Third, economic development planning must reflect private companies' concern for profits. Fourth, economic success requires an educated workforce. Finally, central city governments should practice the habits of growth, without neglecting to plan for the long term. All municipalities, even historically dominant central cities, now have competitors.},

Interviews with planners, councillors, and representatives of the development industry indicate that, while land cost pressures contribute to increasing suburban densities, developers may challenge planning principles related to urban form and function. The study finds that weak political commitment and market pressures frustrate planners' desires to create accessible and open communities.

City planning has had a variable relationship with art, moving between organic, civic minded ideals, and despotic notions of grandeur. Yet, rather than eschewing this history as nostalgic or irrelevant, there are ways in which a connection can be made between planning and art\textemdash{}if art is defined in a particular way. To accomplish this, it is necessary to first recognize that in the history of the human attempt to design cities, the loss of a connection between city planning and art is relatively recent. It is argued that the lost connection is in part a result of a rejection of modernist notions of urbanism. Spanning the history of city planning and city making, the notion of planning as art was in evidence until the mid-20th century, about the time when modernist spatial ideas took hold. It is argued that divorcing all notions of art from city planning practice and theoretical development has been detrimental to the profession. The relevance of art to city planning needs to be reinvigorated, but this will require new ways of thinking, an acceptance of traditionalism broadly defined, and may entail new conceptions about the merger of planning with recent cultural and even scientific theory.},

While proposals for big-box retail have long involved politically sensitive tradecoffs for planners, supercenters bring these into sharp focus by concentrating sustantial wage impacts on one group, grocery works. With much at stake - we estimate direct impacts of hundreds of millions of dollars on each side in the san Francisco region alone-these battles promise to be more intense and challenging than in the past. Yet many regulatory strategies are weakly rationalized, poorly targeted, and legally untested. We clarify key policy questions and offer a case study as a model for understanding the extent and character of expected tradeoffs between winners and losers. In the end, our analysis supports planning strategies explicitly aimed at mitigating costs while leveraging benefits. This will require a thorough assessment of each proposed store's costs and benefits in order to provide a clearer rationale for when supercenters should be approved, denied, or mitigated.

  abstract = {Problem: Many metropolitan jurisdictions face contests over industrial land because growth in the industrial sector is slow while the office and retail sectors and population grow more rapidly. This article presents a methodology for planning and setting priorities for industrial land use under these circumstances. Purpose: This article describes an approach to evaluating market demand for industrial land, applied here to Prince George's County, MD, in order to determine which industrial areas could be rezoned to alternate uses without causing major employment and tax losses to the county. Methods: I led a team that included an urban planning colleague and graduate students in identifying three types of industrial land: economically healthy industrial districts; industrially zoned areas where there was evidence of conflict between industry and alternative residential, commercial, and office land uses; and areas zoned for industry where demand for industrial space and land was weak or nonexistent. The project used data from private data provider CoStar, the U.S. Department of Labor's Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, county zoning maps and tax records, Microsoft Map, and Google Map to assign each industrial district to one of five categories of demand, ranging from weakest (no history of industrial demand) to strongest (economically healthy industrial activity). Results and Conclusions: Two estimates, one based on the projected absorption rate of industrial land over the next 10 years, and one on the industrial acreage exhibiting evidence of weak demand, both suggest a similarly large surplus of industrial land in the county. Further, rezoning and redeveloping industrial districts in the three weakest demand categories would cause the county to lose little industrial employment. Thus, all analyses reach consistent conclusions that the county should release some industrially zoned land for other uses while protecting some that is essential to the local economy. Takeaway for Practice: This article presents a methodology for assessing industrial areas to determine where industrially zoned land could be rezoned at little loss to the local economy; where land use conflicts should be addressed with urban design or industrial land protections; and where industrial areas are economically healthy and important components of the regional economy. Comprehensive plans can improve the health of local economies by identifying districts where industrial activities are strong and essential to the regional economy and encouraging investment in those areas while accommodating and protecting them. Research Support: This research evolved out of two years of work for Prince George's County, MD, by a team from the University of Maryland's urban planning program, supported by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission.},

The first, used to collect data on road paving and housing density in informal settlements in Tijuana, is deemed successful, while the second, used to generate data on recent urban expansion in several Mexican cities, is not. The problem with the second methodology and primary limitation of the online tool is that satellite image data is presented without clear dates. Thus, its usefulness is determined by the time frame of analysis - as the period of time gets shorter, the uncertainty surrounding the end date becomes increasingly problematic.},

Ethnographic examples are used to show how its inhabitants consume the physical and social spaces of this national modern city. The planners did not achieve their aim of designing a new society. Without directly rejecting the town plan, its new inhabitants took over its physical structure, and put into practice their own definitions of ``labor'', ``consumption'' and ``production''. In doing this, they challenged the concept of social order that the governing elite sought to impose on them as a universal, objective order.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the problems associated with the location choice of newly created establishments at the aggregate level. Much work has been done in this domain, however, several issues arise when analyzing involved phenomena, which scholars have yet to fully explore: 1) addressing the excess of zeros problem in the location choice model in highly heterogeneous geographic areas and 2) determining an appropriate way to accommodate spatial effects for location decisions. We tested models that include both stocks of pre-existing establishments and variables that represent measures of accessibility to the workforce and population, proximity to shops, services, transport infrastructure, availability of land, as well as prices and tax levels. We concluded that an establishment does not act in isolation during its decision-making processes and that it is likely to be influenced by other establishments located nearby. When selecting the appropriate location in which to set up in the market, an establishment may consider not only the characteristics of a particular area, but also the characteristics of neighboring zones. Having estimated 84 nested and non-nested count data models, we found that the hurdle models are preferred for taking into account the presence of excess zeros. Hurdle models offer greater flexibility in modeling zero outcomes and relax the assumption that the zero observations and the positive observations come from the same data generating process. In addition, the paper finds that the models tested with the distance matrix indicate that the incorporation of spatial spillovers leads to an enhancement in the models' performance.},

HFA roles have been expanded through top-down political mandates, bottom-up interest group pressures, and complex institutional structures. The article also identifies several challenges to further change, including financial risk, interagency coordination, and agency transparency and accountability. HFAs have become major players in state affordable housing policy and suggests that planners, policy makers and advocates make better use of these agencies in implementing state affordable housing solutions.},

In addition, this paper investigates controversy surrounding attitudes toward the neighborhood unit and the purported ``determinism'' and reformist intents of the concept. It investigates the wide-spread influence of the model on residential design, investigates current attitudes of usefulness of the model, and considers New Urbanism as an opportune tweaking of the design elements of the neighborhood unit. It concludes that the neighborhood unit, while having social influences in residential life, is more accurately termed a physical design model that weaves neighborhood layout and opportunities for interaction.},

The financial support of the United States and World Bank investments sped up this process. A European Union harmonization process is now under way.

The article analyzes the debates over these proposals and the reasons why the city adopted neither approach. While politics had its hand in dooming the proposals, poor planning played a central role as well. The lack of a comparative analytical framework for evaluating the competing ``roads'' and ``rules'' proposals gave detractors the ammunition to oppose either approach on the grounds that the alternative approach would be superior.},

  title = {New {{Growth Theory}},  {{Technology}} and {{Learning}}:  {{A Practitioner}}'s {{Guide}}},
  abstract = {New Growth Theory emphasizes that economic growth results from the increasing returns 
associated with new knowledge. Knowledge has different properties than other economic goods 
(being non-rival, and partly excludable). The ability to grow the economy by increasing 
knowledge rather than labor or capital creates opportunities for nearly boundless growth. 
Markets fail to produce enough knowledge because innovators cannot capture all of the gains 
associated with creating new knowledge. And because knowledge can be infinitely reused at 
zero marginal cost, firms who use knowledge in production can earn quasi-monopoly profits. 
All forms of knowledge, from big science to better ways to sew a shirt exhibit these properties 
and contribute to growth. Economies with widespread increasing returns are unlikely to develop 
along a unique equilibrium path. Development may be a process of creative destruction, with a 
succession of monopolistically competitive technologies and firms. Markets alone may not 
converge on a single most efficient solution, and technological and regional development will 
tend to exhibit path dependence. 
History, institutions and geography all shape the development of knowledge-based economies. 
History matters because increasing returns generate positive feedbacks that tend to cause 
economies to ``lock in'' to particular technologies and locations. Development is in part chaotic 
because small events at critical times can have persistent, long term impacts on patterns of 
economic activity. Institutions matter because they shape the environment for the production 
and employment of new knowledge. Societies that generate and tolerate new ideas, and that 
continuously adapt to changing economic and technological circumstances are a precondition to 
sustained economic growth. Geography matters because knowledge doesn't move frictionlessly 
among economic actors. Important parts of knowledge are tacit, and embedded in the routines of 
individuals and organizations in different places. 
New Growth Theory, and the increasing returns associated with knowledge have many 
implications for economic development policy. New Growth Theory underscores the importance 
of investing in new knowledge creation to sustain growth. Policy makers will need to pay 
careful attention to all of the factors that provide incentives for knowledge creation (research and 
development, the education system, entrepreneurship and the tolerance for diversity, 
macroeconomic expectations, openness to trade). Because it undermines the notion of a single, 
optimal general equilibrium, New Growth Theory implies that economics will be less capable of 
predicting future outcomes.},

  volume = {76},
  issn = {01944363},
  doi = {10.1080/01944361003646471},
  abstract = {Problem: The future of compact development depends in part on understanding and shaping the public's attitudes toward it. Previous studies have suggested life cycle, socioeconomic, attitudinal, and ideological dimensions to preferences regarding development patterns, but rarely have all of these factors been examined systematically across a broad, generalizable sample of respondents. Purpose: To examine public attitudes toward compact development, we asked survey respondents to weigh four important tradeoffs between compact and sprawling growth. We assess the relative influence of a variety of individual characteristics on these attitudes. Methods: We use results from two large-scale, randomized telephone surveys, one conducted in California in 2002 and the other in four other southwestern states in 2007. Using logistic regression, we assess which personal characteristics are associated with stated preferences regarding compact development, and illustrate their degree of influence. Results and conclusions: Support for the compact development alternatives is significant, in some cases exceeding support for traditional, decentralized suburban patterns. However, question wording appears to matter considerably, and individuals' beliefs about different facets of compact development are often inconsistent. Although race, income, age, and the presence of children in the household are strongly associated with some views on the four tradeoffs, only political ideology is consistently associated with opposition to compact development. Takeaway for practice: The significant support evident for compact development may not translate into actual housing choices unless local governments and lenders do more to support the production of such housing and neighborhood environments. If, as our results suggest, a major constituency for transit-oriented and mixed-use projects is low income residents, renters, and minorities, then well crafted urban infill projects that take into account the needs of these groups will help fulfill the potential of smart growth. Advocates might also frame compact development to appeal more to political conservatives. Research support: The 2002 survey was conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California, with financial support from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, James Irvine Foundation, and David and Lucille Packard Foundation. The 2007 survey was conducted and supported by the Institute for Social Science Research at Arizona State University. All views expressed are solely those of the authors, not these organizations.},

A list of suggested criteria for plan evaluation during plan preparation is then presented, to be used to make the plan better. Appropriate criteria for a plan are not easy to devise, and the postmodern critique of planning makes this task more difficult still. These issues are explored as well.},

Described by some as the paradigm of the 1990s, it proposes a fundamental challenge to the practice of planning that seeks both to explain where planning has gone wrong and (more controversially) to identify ways forward. The broad approach itself and advocates of it have lacked the advantage of any critique. This paper provides such an opportunity. Following a brief outline of communicative action, we identify three broad areas of concern that militate against the option of a collaborative planning approach. More specifically, we identify problematic assumptions in Habermas's original theoretical distinction of communicative action as a fourth separate concept of sociological action. Although we accept its useful dissection of planning and the role of values and consensus-building in decision-settings, we consider that collaborative planning theory fails to incorporate adequately the peculiar political and professional nuances that exist in planning practice. We conclude our critique by raising programmatic points for planning theory and practice in general.},

Taking cues from the film and based on interviews with memory workers in Berlin, the article considers the problems surrounding national identity narrative (re)construction in Germany and the role of spatial imagination necessarily invoked by this. Foregrounding the role of capital city planning in etching or erasing memory traces in identity construction, the argument is made that in the presentation of identity ambivalence Berlin fortunately remains an uneasy place where a national narrative of continuity exists in tension with an identity narrative which seeks to incorporate rupture.},

Rather than go quietly, they formed a committee, gathered economic survey data, and lobbied federal and state officials, ultimately affecting New Deal legislation. When their lobbying yielded little increased security, they adopted the methods of their rent striking forebears in Manhattan tenements, declared solidarity, and struck for lower mortgage payments. Although hundreds ultimately lost their homes, their example stands as a reminder of the promise of democratic participation in times of crisis.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of determining the structure of clustered data, without prior
knowledge of the number of clusters or any other information about their composition. Data
are represented by a mixture model in which each component corresponds to a different
cluster. Models with varying geometric properties are obtained through Gaussian components
with different parameterizations and cross-cluster constraints. Noise and outliers can
be modeled by adding a Poisson process component. Partitions are determined by the EM
(expectation-maximization) algorithm for maximum likelihood, with initial values from agglomerative
hierarchical clustering.
Models are compared using an approximation to the Bayes factor based on the Bayesian
Information Criterion (BIC); unlike significance tests, this allows comparison of more than
two models at the same time, and removes the restriction that the models compared be
nested. The problems of determining the number of clusters and the clustering method
are solved simultaneously by choosing the best model. Moreover, the EM result provides a
measure of uncertainty about the associated classification of each data point.
Examples are given, showing that this approach can give performance that is much better
than standard procedures, which often fail to identify groups that are either overlapping or
of varying sizes and shapes.},

This article explains how local planning authorities in Norway introduce new planning practices relating to the management of land and planning procedures. The observed new practices have been introduced even though the formal hierarchical structure of the planning law has stayed unchanged. They are analysed as outcomes of the changing use of tools under the three models for co-ordinating behaviour: hierarchy understood as government, market and network. First, the existing planning system is analysed to explain the legal possibilities for changing planning practices informally. Two categories of practices are then discussed: the use of the detailed development plan as an implementation instrument, and the use of the regulatory power in framing interconnections and responsibilities towards stakeholders. The main conclusion is that regulatory tools have lost some strength in favour of tools under the network model, and that the observed changes in planning practices are mostly a result of mutual dependencies between these two models for co-ordinating behaviour.},

Since 2001 the English planning system has been subject to a complex series of reforms designed to modernise its workings. Central to this have been calls for a culture change, focusing on professional planners in the public sector. The discourse of culture change is rooted in the managerialist thinking that has been central to long-term processes of state restructuring. Du Gay describes this as a project designed to change the identities of public servants. This article therefore explores the messy ways in which reform has sought to re-regulate the identities of English planners, and the response from planners themselves as they have begun to negotiate these changes to their identities and practices. It is argued that attentiveness to the lived experience of change can help to inform a more critical and nuanced account of the normative promises of planning reform.},

  title = {Towards a Methodology to Identify and Characterize Urban Sub-Centres:  {{Employment Entropy Information}} versus {{Employment Density}}},
  abstract = {ABSTRACT: 
In last decades, the spatial structure of the metropolitan areas has been characterized by an 
urban dynamics towards a more polynucleated structure, breaking with the paradigm of the 
monocentric city. The specialized literature has studied these polynucleated urban structures 
by identifying the nuclei (sub-
centres) that are with
in of the metropolitan areas. According to 
this objective, there are two approaches to identify sub-
centres: by analyzing the employment or population density and by studying the mobility flows. Although, huge efforts have been done in the density approach, there are still some uncertainty points to solve: the density analysis could not identify and characterize simultaneously the sub-
centres. That means 
distinguish those sub-
centres that only attract workers (in-commuting flows) or retain their resident workers to those sub
-centres that are able to attract flows and retain their resident 
employed population at the same time. 
In this paper, a new integrated methodology to identify and characterize simultaneously urban sub-centres is proposed by using an Employment Entropy function. In comparison with the 
density models, now it is possible to identify sub-centres and characterize them by 
``emerging'' or ``large-mature'' by analyzing their Employment Entropy Information. In doing 
so, the Employment Entropy Information of each municipality is divided into two Entropy 
Information functions: the resident workers -RW- and the in-
commuting flows -IF-  Entropy 
Information functions. So, the paper is organized as following: firstly, the efficacy of the 
proposed methodology is tested in the Barcelona Metropolitan Region from 1991 to 2001 and 
secondly, the impact of these identified and characterized sub
-centres on the urban spatial 
structure is studied by analyzing the evolution of polycentrism level and their influence on the urban hierarchy.  
The results suggest that in comparison with identifying sub-centres by using the standard density model, the municipalities identified as sub-centres by using ``this double'' Employment Entropy Information functions 
are more dominant in t
erms of in-commuting 
flows, more self-contained, and its influence on the urban structure are more significant, 
entailing a more polynucleated metropolitan structure.},

It draws on insights in cultural geography and the planning archive on Birmingham's Chinese Quarter, to show that the epistemology in play weaves together claims of a factual, authentic multiculturalism based on particular presences with an implicit planning imaginary of cultural identity. It then demonstrates that the planning imaginary in question is structured like a text with a signifying system containing mimetic and disseminative properties. The article concludes by proposing a number of implications from the case study for the planning of Birmingham's multicultural future. When postmodern architectural `historicism' borrows architectural idioms from far-flung periods without any regard for idiomatic coherence or reproduction of appropriate context, this \ldots{} can be seen as a foregrounding of radical citationality, of the suggestion that the `aura' of the original cannot be structurally privileged.

While the modalities of translating Lefebvre vary depending on the subject matter, transfiguring Lefebvre for today is most plausible when taking into account the dialectical nature of his urbanism and the open-ended and integral character of his marxism.},

  abstract = {This paper uses several events in New York in the late 1990s to launch two central arguments about the changing relationship between neoliberal urbanism and so\textendash{}called globalization. First, much as the neoliberal state becomes a consummate agent of\textemdash{}rather than a regulator of\textemdash{}the market, the new revanchist urbanism that replaces liberal urban policy in cities of the advanced capitalist world increasingly expresses the impulses of capitalist production rather than social reproduction. As globalization bespeaks a rescaling of the global, the scale of the urban is recast. The true global cities may be the rapidly growing metropolitan economies of Asia, Latin America, and (to a lesser extent) Africa, as much as the command centers of Europe, North America and Japan. Second, the process of gentrification, which initially emerged as a sporadic, quaint, and local anomaly in the housing markets of some command\textendash{}center cities, is now thoroughly generalized as an urban strategy that takes over from liberal urban policy. No longer isolated or restricted to Europe, North America, or Oceania, the impulse behind gentrification is now generalized; its incidence is global, and it is densely connected into the circuits of global capital and cultural circulation. What connects these two arguments is the shift from an urban scale defined according to the conditions of social reproduction to one in which the investment of productive capital holds definitive precedence.},

The results suggest that while the spatial pattern of household income became more decentralized and less clustered during the 1990s, the patterns established as of 1990 were highly persistent over the decade. Factors associated with metropolitan area size and growth affected changes in both the degree of centralization and the degree of clustering. Although traditional determinants of suburbanization were associated with increases in income decentralization during the 1990s, densely developed cities with an increase in the percentage of white residents saw increases in income centralization during the decade. Furthermore, changes in the patterns observed were shaped by various policy influences, including the number of Low Income Housing Tax Credit units, urban containment policies, and the degree of local government fragmentation.},

  abstract = {Problem: What is a ``good plan''? Among their key goals, plans aim to communicate, influence and engage. Persuasiveness (the ability to engage and motivate) is, therefore, an essential plan quality. Unfortunately, all too many comprehensive plans lack this important quality. In addition, state planning mandates intended to strengthen planning can instead worsen this shortcoming. Purpose: To develop a methodology to measure and compare the communicative and persuasive qualities of plans in states with and without planning mandates. Methods: A specially designed protocol was developed to measure the communicative and persuasive qualities of comprehensive plans. Plans of 20 municipalities in states with planning mandates were compared with those of 20 municipalities in states without planning mandates. Statistical analyses of the results were conducted using the Wilcoxon\textendash{}Mann\textendash{}Whitney (U) test and simple t tests. Results and conclusions: Requiring local governments to prepare plans did not result in better plans\textemdash{}at least as measured by a protocol tailored specifically to assess the persuasiveness and communicative quality of plans. Plans prepared in mandate states were much more rigid and standardized than those prepared in nonmandate states. Nonmandated plans also scored much higher in terms of their narrative and storytelling qualities than mandated plans. Private consultant involvement in plan making significantly increased the communicative and persuasive qualities of plans. Takeaway for practice: Plans in all 40 municipalities fell far short of the ideal communicative and persuasive qualities set forth in the protocol. The deficiency was greatest in states with planning mandates. The involvement of private consultants had a positive impact on plan quality, while the provision of state funding for planning did not. Research support: None.},

  shorttitle = {Urban {{Ecological Systems}}},
  abstract = {Ecological studies of terrestrial urban systems have been approached along several kinds of contrasts: ecology in as opposed to ecology of cities; biogeochemical compared to organismal perspectives, land use planning versus biological, and disciplinary versus interdisciplinary. In order to point out how urban ecological studies are poised for significant integration, we review key aspects of these disparate literatures. We emphasize an open definition of urban systems that accounts for the exchanges of material and influence between cities and surrounding landscapes. Research on ecology in urban systems highlights the nature of the physical environment, including urban climate, hydrology, and soils. Biotic research has studied flora, fauna, and vegetation, including trophic effects of wildlife and pets. Unexpected interactions among soil chemistry, leaf litter quality, and exotic invertebrates exemplify the novel kinds of interactions that can occur in urban systems. Vegetation and faunal responses suggest that the configuration of spatial heterogeneity is especially important in urban systems. This insight parallels the concern in the literature on the ecological dimensions of land use planning. The contrasting approach of ecology of cities has used a strategy of biogeochemical budgets, ecological footprints, and summaries of citywide species richness. Contemporary ecosystem approaches have begun to integrate organismal, nutrient, and energetic approaches, and to show the need for understanding the social dimensions of urban ecology. Social structure and the social allocation of natural and institutional resources are subjects that are well understood within social sciences, and that can be readily accommodated in ecosystem models of metropolitan areas. Likewise, the sophisticated understanding of spatial dimensions of social differentiation has parallels with concepts and data on patch dynamics in ecology and sets the stage for comprehensive understanding of urban ecosystems. The linkages are captured in the human ecosystem framework.},

But are these old and new goals for workforce development reconcilable? Does a more employer- and industry-focused approach affects the ability of policymakers and practitioners to address the problems of low-wage labor markets? This article examines a recent initiative in Chicago to establish sector-based workforce centers in the manufacturing and service industries. This case study finds that efforts to ``rework'' the public workforce development system to meet the needs of employers can be at odds with efforts to meet the needs of disadvantaged populations. But greater proximity to employers can also enhance the system's capacity to promote more progressive human resource practices and equitable labor market outcomes.},

This article extends this critique from cost and patronage forecasting to other aspects of transit planning, particularly routing and tunneling safety evaluations, through a case study of the planning for the Wilshire ``Red Line'' subway in Los Angeles\textemdash{}a long-debated and still active project. Specifically, we examine the decision-making process behind the decades of planning of the Wilshire Red Line subway, which has seen conventional routing and alignment studies alternately manipulated, ignored, and blocked in response to the shifting views of key public officials. While political influence over planning processes is both inevitable and probably desirable, the extent to which modal, cost, ridership, and route analyses of the proposed Wilshire subway have been crafted, manipulated, and ignored to serve prevailing, if ever shifting, local political preferences calls into question the role and legitimacy of such analyses.},

I argue that the main problem with current incentive policies is that state and local governments often provide incentives that are not in the best interest of that state or local area, for example that are excessively costly per job created, or that provide jobs that do not improve the job opportunities of local residents. I suggest that reforms should be ``bottom-up'' rather than ``top-down.'' Regulation of incentives by the federal government may prevent both desirable and undesirable incentives. ``Bottom-up'' reforms would include more information on incentive offers, a budget constraint on the volume of incentives, stronger standards for job quality and job accessibility for the local unemployed, and better benefit-cost analyses of incentives.},

Rather, such reform can improve the fit between people's transportation-land use preferences and actual neighborhood choices. This fit is compared here between two distinct U.S. metropolitan areas: Boston and Atlanta. In providing a greater range of neighborhood types, Boston allowed a closer fit between household transportation-land use preference and actual neighborhood choice than did Atlanta. This suggests the potential gains in household choice from removal of barriers to alternative development forms.},

  abstract = {Among the many approaches being taken to sustainable development planning and policy, a basic dichotomy exists. The dichotomy is the classic one recognized over a century ago by pragmatist philosopher William James\textemdash{}between the tough minded and the tender minded, or in this case, those who trust in more and better information to address sustainability challenges and those who rest on the power of a plurality of voices. In this paper we demonstrate how this dichotomy confounds the construction of a holistic, actionable sustainability planning paradigm, frustrating in pragmatic terms the effort to develop sustainability planning that makes a difference. We argue for an approach to sustainable development grounded in the philosophy of pragmatism as a means to connect tough and tender minded perspectives on sustainability planning, policy and action. After detailing how tough and tender minded temperaments among sustainability advocates translate into different types of understandings and initiatives, a pragmatic framework for a holistic sustainability planning and policy suite is proposed. This framework is argued based on an understanding of pragmatic theories of truth and rationality, integration and a process basis for action, and human experience as a touchstone for public values and action priorities. This article contributes to the growing body of planning scholarship that draws upon pragmatic philosophy, connecting this with the growing body of work within environmental philosophy that highlights the utility of pragmatism in building a philosophy of sustainable development. If planners and members of the democratic public can work towards a common understanding that it is a process of continuous communication and interaction among citizens and experts that needs to be sustained in the push toward sustainable development, that knowledge is to be generated and tested in public contexts, and that stories have standing alongside scientific models and statistics, important moves toward sustainability can be made in the planning profession as a whole.},

  abstract = {Adaptation to climate change is an imperative and an institutional challenge. This paper argues that the operationalisation of climate adaptation is a crucial element of a comprehensive response to the impacts of climate change on human settlements, including major cities and metropolitan areas. In this instance, the operationalisation of climate adaptation refers to climate adaptation becoming institutionally codified and implemented through planning policies and objectives, making it a central tenet of planning governance. This paper has three key purposes. First, it develops conceptual understandings of climate adaptation as an institutional challenge. Second, it identifies the intersection of this problem with planning and examines how planning regimes, as institutions, can better manage stress created by climate change impacts in human settlements. Third, it reports empirical findings focused on how the metro-regional planning regime in Southeast Queensland (SEQ), Australia, has institutionally responded to the challenge of operationalising climate adaptation. Drawing on key social scientific theories of institutionalism, it is argued that the success or failure of the SEQ planning regime's response to the imperative of climate adaptation is contingent on its ability to undergo institutional change. It is further argued that a capacity for institutional change is heavily conditioned by the influence of internal and external pathways and barriers to change, which facilitate or hinder change processes. The paper concludes that the SEQ metro-regional planning regime has undergone some institutional change but has not yet undergone change sufficient to fully operationalise climate adaptation as a central tenet of planning governance in the region.},

A newly developed mapping method, the Cadastral-based Expert Dasymetric System (CEDS), calculates population in hyper-heterogeneous urban areas better than traditional mapping techniques. A case study estimating population potentially impacted by flood hazard in New York City compares the impacted population determined by CEDS with that derived by centroid-containment method and filtered areal-weighting interpolation. Compared to CEDS, 37\% and 72\% fewer people are estimated to be at risk from floods city-wide, using conventional areal weighting of census data, and centroid-containment selection, respectively. Undercounting of impacted population could have serious implications for emergency management and disaster planning. Ethnic/racial populations are also spatially disaggregated to determine any environmental justice impacts with flood risk. Minorities are disproportionately undercounted using traditional methods. Underestimating more vulnerable sub-populations impairs preparedness and relief efforts.},

The authors advance knowledge in this realm by employing anually updated, readily available indicators created from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and assessor's data from Washington, D.C., census tracts for 1995 to 2005 to estimate a hazard model of the year when consistent, substantial, and sustained housing price appreciation starts in disadvantaged neighborhoods, based on predictors measured one and two years in advance. The results suggest that proximity to stronger neighborhoods, a robust metropolitan housing market, and inflows of higher-status home buyers are key predictors of appreciation onset in disadvantaged neighborhoods, but replications and refinements are needed before firm generalizations about this process can be made.},

Also described is the pattern of job growth within the inner city. The authors find that tracts that grew faster tended to be closer to downtown, with access to transit and adjacent to areas with higher population growth. However, tracts with higher poverty rates experienced less job growth, indicating that barriers still exist in the inner city.},

This raises the important issue of how normative aspirations of deliberative planning can be reconciled with actual planning practices.

Yet, despite popular conceptions of the city as a progressive ecotopia and the accolades of planners seeking to emulate its innovations, Portland's sustainability successes are inequitably distributed. Drawing on census data, popular media, newspaper archives, city planning documents, and secondary source histories, we attempt to elucidate the structural origins of Portland's ``uneven development,'' exploring how and why the urban core of this paragon of sustainability has become more White and affluent while its outer eastside has become more diverse and poor. We explain how a ``sustainability fix''\textemdash{}in this case, green investment in the city's core\textemdash{}ultimately contributed to the demarcation of racialized poverty along 82nd Avenue, a major north\textendash{}south arterial marking the boundary of East Portland. Our account of structural processes taking place at multiple scales contributes to a growing body of literature on eco-gentrification and displacement and inner-ring suburban change while empirically demonstrating how Portland's advances in sustainability have come at the cost of East Portland's devaluation. Our ``30,000 foot'' perspective reveals systemic patterns that might then guide more fine-grained analyses of particular political-socio-cultural processes, while providing cautionary insights into current efforts to extend the city's sustainability initiatives using the same green development model.},

In the first part of this article, I summarize and critique the argument that CA theory is unrealistic explaining of how CA analysts care more about relevant consequences than causal certainty. In the second part of the article, taking some conceptual advice from social theorist Jurgen Habermas, I show how CA analysis can combine structural and intentional concepts to revise and integrate the apparent antagonism between comprehensiveness and compromise for planning practice. I conclude that a pragmatic CA provides a useful and critical theory for planning practice that remains open to future challenge and debate.},

In Chicago between 1978 and 1987 massive downtown growth produced industrial displacement\textendash{}the forced relocation of businesses\textendash{}alongside the new investment, jobs, and tax income. Studies of two Chicago industrial districts show that industrial displacement is widespread but has had different impacts on specific industries, sizes of firms, and owners or tenants, In one district, industries and their industrial council have resisted displacement by opposing loft conversions and proposing municipal zoning legislation to protect viable manufacturing areas. Although it is difficult to achieve effective community organizing and creative land use planning, the political will to do so may lead to a balance between downtown and the neighborhoods.},

  abstract = {Quantitative indices of residential segregation have been with us for half a century, but suffer significant limitations. While useful for comparison among regions, summary indices fail to reveal spatial aspects of segregation. Such measures generally consider only the population mix within zones, not between them. Zone boundaries are treated as impenetrable barriers to interaction between population subgroups, so that measurement of segregation is constrained by the zoning system, which bears no necessary relation to interaction among population subgroups. A segregation measurement approach less constrained by the chosen zoning system, which enables visualization of segregation levels at the local scale and accounts for the spatial dimension of segregation, is required. We propose a kernel density estimation approach to model spatial aspects of segregation. This provides an explicitly geographical framework for modeling and visualizing local spatial segregation. The density estimation approach lends itself to development of an index of spatial segregation with the advantage of functional compatibility with the most widely used index of segregation (the dissimilarity index D). We provide a short review of the literature on measuring segregation, briefly describe the kernel density estimation method, and illustrate how the method can be used for measuring segregation. Examples using a simulated landscape and two empirical cases in Washington, DC and Philadelphia, PA are presented.},

  abstract = {Public participation has become a central element of planning activity over the last decades. The planning literature has given considerable attention to participation in theory and practice, discussing its benefits for democratic governance, its multiple goals and criteria for assessing success. Although planning academics and practitioners understand the importance of participation and know that participatory processes often fail, the field of participation evaluation lags behind. This paper explores how often, why and how planners evaluate participation in practice. It builds on data collected through a nationally representative survey of 761 AICP-certified planners. We find that they rarely evaluate participation formally. Informal evaluations rely on a wide range of criteria about participation processes and outcomes consistent with the criteria identified by planning theory. The paper presents these evaluation criteria and the practices and recommendation of the planners with most experience in participation evaluation.},

The data-driven component of IDM employs a flexible empirical sampling approach to acquire information on the data densities of individual ancillary classes, and it uses the ratio of class densities to redistribute population to sub-source zone areas. A summary statistics table characterizing the resulting dasymetric map can be used to compare the quality of the output of different IDM parameterizations. A case study of four population variables is used to demonstrate IDM and provide a visual and quantitative error assessment comparing various IDM parameterizations with areal weighting and conventional "binary" dasymetric mapping. Intelligent dasymetric mapping outperforms areal weighting, and certain IDM parameterizations outperform binary dasymetric mapping.},

After more than forty years of urban policy in practice, then, the question of whether we have learned from experience is a pertinent one. This review paper contemplates the continued focus on ``areas'' in urban policy, forwards a spatio-conceptual framework for understanding ``urban problems'', and then identifies some additional theoretical and conceptual issues. The questions of whether we have learned from past experience and what a ``good'' urban policy might look like are posed in the penultimate section. The answers are not necessarily encouraging.},

A closer look at the working methods employed and images produced by Burnham and his staff reveals their role in cultivating a shared civic imaginary. That is, drawing upon existing widespread cultural enthusiasm for viewing the city from above, they stimulated the imagination toward the city as it might be, while positioning themselves as new kinds of experts tasked with reconciling discrepancies between the built and imagined city on behalf of the public. I structure the article in particular around the discussion of three images: San Francisco as envisaged from the Twin Peaks viewing platform, published in Report on a Plan for San Francisco (1905); a bird's-eye view of Chicago as envisaged in a watercolor by Jules Guerin, published in The Plan of Chicago (1909); and a Chicago civic center as envisaged in another watercolor by Jules Guerin, published in The Plan of Chicago (1909). Through formal and discursive consideration of these images, I argue that a burgeoning sense of the civic imaginary shared by professionals, elites, and ordinary citizens played a crucial role in the institution of the city-planning profession in the first decade of the twentieth century. Regardless of the specific details and subsequent status of the plans to which they refer, the images are important to consider in their own right. As instruments in a recasting of urban form, they materialize a new sense of the city as both malleable and the object of concern for a new kind of specialist.},

Contrary to Mills's claims, my suggestion that the fair equality of opportunity principle can remedy socioeconomic disadvantages caused by the legacy of racial oppression is compatible with Rawls's framework, does not conflate distributive justice with corrective justice, and does not confuse racial injustice with economic injustice. I also raise doubts about Mills's project to radically reconstruct contractarian political philosophy. He seeks to displace ideal theory with nonideal theory by foregrounding the realities of past racial domination. Against this approach, I argue that an ideal theory that abstracts away from these realities is not inherently ideological, useless for corrective justice, or too ideal to guide social reform. And I defend the view that ideal theory is indispensible for nonideal theorizing about racial justice.},

  abstract = {Planning is both an interdisciplinary and a collaborative endeavour. A range of disciplines are involved in planning, which arguably all have a specific frame through which they perceive reality and address planning issues. Three main disciplinary frames can be discerned: analytical, design and negotiation. Within this context, increasing usage is made of planning support systems (PSS), which are integrated sets of tools, often digital, aiming to support different tasks in the planning process. PSS arguably have the potential to support the planning process by facilitating interdisciplinary learning processes, involving ``frame reflection'' by different disciplinary actors. This paper studies this assumption through two case studies in which a PSS was applied in an interdisciplinary setting. It was found that ``frame reflection'' (double-loop learning) occurred in only one of the two case studies -and that this involved several frictions between disciplines. In the other case study more practical forms of learning were found (single-loop learning) \textendash{} also valuable for planning. It is concluded that PSS have potential for interdisciplinary learning, particularly where the impact analysis function and a shared spatial language improve the quality of the dialogue. With regard to the latter, however, PSS should be prevented from dominating the discussion as this is something which is particularly problematic for stakeholders with a design frame. In future research, the role of local stakeholders in relation to PSS and interdisciplinary learning could also be taken into account.},

Land trusts present uniform preference for parcels that provide ecosystem services, wildlife habitat, viewsheds, local heritage, and agricultural productivity. The list of benefits provided by land trusts was compared to a literature review drawing from farmland amenity, agritourism, farmland preservation, and ecosystems studies to reveal the range of market values for the various benefits of farmland. The market value of farmland services varies from -\$37,541 to 124,000 per acre depending on the method of analysis and location of the farm. This research has strong implications for land-use planning, economic opportunities, and ecosystems infrastructure in peri-urban areas.},

  abstract = {In the former Soviet Union, traditional urban districts with pre\textendash{}World War II housing were considered obsolete and the aim was to demolish them, but in practice they were frequently ignored, because efforts were focused on new housing production in order to address acute housing shortages. Inertial forces stymied plan implementation for older districts during a rich period of plan making while new residential districts were built at a fast pace on virgin land. This research analyzes more than a dozen written planning documents from various periods during the twentieth century for Tartu, Estonia, where, had mid-twentieth century town plans been implemented, entire districts of nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century wooden houses and apartment buildings would have been demolished. Findings suggest that several factors acted in concert to set the conditions for both neglect and preservation of such districts during the second half of the twentieth century that resulted in continuous occupancy of the dwellings and preserved the built form (and the social structure) of the district. These factors include a focus on building new housing and new districts rather than renovating older districts; a lack of resources to renovate older districts; and a lack of resources to implement plans. This synthesis of town planning in Estonia demonstrates how planning ideas have evolved throughout the twentieth century parallel to\textemdash{}but temporally delayed compared to\textemdash{}Western Europe and North America.},

To clarify the role that cases can play, this article investigates how two other professional fields (law and medical ethics) have used cases to analyze practical ethics. The author argues that law and medicine use studies to develop ``moral taxonomies''\textemdash{}classifications of important cases that help clarify the meaning and limits of ambiguous values, principles, and maxims. Three features characterize case ethics in law and medicine: (1) a focus on hard cases, in which key values or principles are ambiguous or in conflict; (2) use of analogical reasoning to analyze those cases, to determine which previously resolved cases they resemble and which they do not; and (3) identification of low-level principles that underwrite these judgments of similarity and difference and can help inform judgments about future cases.},

This paper estimates cleanup benefits based on a nationally representative sample of brownfields using a variety of quasi-experimental techniques. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that combines non-public EPA administrative records with high-resolution, high-frequency housing data to estimate the effects of brownfield cleanup across the entire federal Brownfields Program. We find increases in property values accompanying cleanup, ranging from 4.9\% to 11.1\%; for a welfare interpretation that does not rely on the intertemporal stability of the hedonic price function, a double-difference matching estimator finds even larger effects of up to 32.2\%. Our various specifications lead to the common conclusion that Brownfields Program cleanups yield a positive, statistically significant, but highly-localized effect on housing prices.},

In five cities, the authors analyze the interrelationships among a broad set of census tract indicators related to mortgage market activity; home prices; jobs and firms; demographic, socioeconomic, and housing stock characteristics; crime; and public assistance and health. Through factor analysis, they identify four to six neighborhood dimensions among these indicators that are common across cities. Using regression, the authors identify a parsimonious number of indicators that are inexpensive, annually updated, and available for all U.S. communities yet robustly capture significant variation in these neighborhood dimensions. Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data on mortgage approval rates, loan amounts, and loan applications and Dunn and Bradstreet data on businesses comprise such a set for four of the dimensions.},

These involve a shift towards more city centre residential development and, associated with the 24-Hour City agenda, a shift towards the development of evening/night-time economies (ENTEs). Mixed land uses are seen as an essential component of this vitality. But conflicts often arise from different land uses in close proximity, which, in turn, suggests a need for the sensitive management of urban areas in general and the ENTE in particular. Focusing on the management of activities in space and time in the ENTE of UK cities, this article explores how planning and liquor licensing controls, the two main sets of contextual controls for the ENTE, provide both the context for more active forms of management and policing and frame an opportunity space for behaviour and conduct. The article's overarching argument is that the management of the ETNE should be considered in terms of a fine-grained understanding of space and time.},

  abstract = {Problem: As planners grow increasingly confident that they have settled on the right concepts and methods to conduct stakeholder-based collaboration, they are not considering what can be achieved through other collaborative approaches. Purpose: We aimed to explore how creating a network of place- and stakeholder-based collaboratives using communities of practice could strengthen individual collaboratives and achieve network synergies. Methods: Using a case study approach, we draw out lessons for collaborative planning from our research on the U.S. Fire Learning Network (FLN), a collaborative initiative to restore ecosystems that depend on fire. We analyzed data from over 140 interviews, hundreds of documents including restoration plans, newsletters, meeting summaries, maps, and various other reports, and observations at more than a dozen regional and national meetings. Results and conclusions: We conclude that the FLN nurtures expertise in ecological fire restoration and collaborative planning by linking multi-stakeholder collaboratives to regional communities of practice. Moreover, this linkage creates and sustains a network of collaboratives that amplify the potential for fundamental change in the culture and practice of fire management. Takeaway for practice: A community of practice is an effective approach to collaboration in situations where the purpose is to expand expertise rather than to resolve conflict and reach consensus. Moreover, a community of practice can link stakeholder-based collaboratives to create a whole greater than the sum of its parts. Realizing this potential requires questioning the universality of some of the core principles of stakeholder-based collaborative planning and diversifying the collaborative planning toolkit. Research support: This research was supported by the Northern Research Station of the U. S. Forest Service and The Nature Conservancy.},

After a brief review that places this research within the literature on gated communities, the organization of the article follows the chronology of Argentina's national governments from 1976 until 1999. The article links the changes in national industrialization policies with the allocation of land for the development of gated communities in Buenos Aires's suburbs. The article concludes with an assessment of the effects these spatial changes had on the suburban polity.},

TCT makes the case for planning in three ways: (1) rejecting generalizations, it focuses debate on specific cases; (2) breaking the link between planning and government, it disarms conservative critics; (3) it provides an authoritative theoretical base for answering neoliberal attacks on public planning. Convincing people that planning (not only as public intervention) is necessary and enhances their welfare is an argument that can be won.},

Although adjustments to the principles of zoning have assisted its implementation at sea, inherent tensions remain, arising from its rationalist basis and divisive approach, and are exacerbated by the dynamic nature of the marine environment.

Organizations have persistent and repeated interactions about many issues, have fractured capabilities and authorities, and make multiple, overlapping, and interacting plans. Some of these plans are public and some of them are kept private because the plan makers and plan users can benefit from doing so. The public-ness or privateness of plans and that of the processes that make plans serve distinct purposes. Examples from recent recovery planning in New Orleans illustrate why and in what circumstances individuals, voluntary groups, and governments choose to plan in public, make their resulting plans public, and find the public plans of others credible. Plans as rhetorics of action, intention, commitment, and influence can be more effective if revealed strategically to particular audiences at particular times.},

  abstract = {The article presents the results of a study investigating the growth of metropolitan London from the second half of the nineteenth century to the present. A high-resolution longitudinal land-use database, assembled from historical Ordnance Survey maps, is used to trace the patterns of land development in a 200 km2 area of West London from 1875 to the present. The land-use database is then employed to develop a cellular automata model, which explores the impact of key forces shaping the patterns of metropolitan growth. The analysis highlights the interplay of three critical factors: (1) the preurban spatial structure determined by the patterns of settlements and infrastructure predating the expansion of the metropolis; (2) the urban code representing a set of consistent rules that describe the spatial interaction of land uses with elements of the built environment; and (3) the mixture of planning and development policies advanced by public and private initiatives related to infrastructure investments, density regulation, and open space preservation. Contrary to the popular view rendering the growth of London as an outcome of uncoordinated private initiatives and market-based forces, the study advances the argument that planning played an important role in shaping the patterns of metropolitan expansion. Our analysis reveals, however, that the impact of planning was strongly conditioned by the elements of the preurban spatial structure and the mechanisms of the urban code.},

These policies are based on extensive strategic planning, public-private partnerships, foundations of technology, human resources and capital, and the development of strategic industrial clusters.

One theme has been an increased attention to the service mission of universities, a matter of special importance to planning programs. The other has been an increased emphasis on accountability and performance assessment, an emphasis that has attracted much attention in ACSP in recent years. This article offers some starting points for grappling with the difficult task of assessing performance in the area of public service. The article reviews the history of these converging themes\textemdash{}nationally and within the planning academy\textemdash{}and draws upon the assessment literature to offer a framework and tool for conducting performance assessment of service activities at both the individual and program level.},

It builds on a historical comparison between the American 19th century sanitation movement and this new agenda. Striking similarities emerge. While they both represent genuine efforts to foster health-supportive environments, they also rely on similar and problematic environmental determinism and positive modernism assumptions, and imply moral and disciplinary control goals. It is argued that environmental and sustainability arguments are ethically superior and more compatible with the American planners' code of ethics than the public health rationale for planning for physically active lifestyles.},

Jurisdictions in Florida and Washington were sampled in 1991 and in 1999 to determine the extent to which their plans' hazard mitigation components changed and to identify factors driving communities to adopt stronger policies. Results indicate the plans of local jurisdictions improved and that legal reform, repetitive damage to property, and citizen participation can facilitate an adaptive learning process.

This long-held paradigm is based on a weak knowledge of the processes underpinning the emergence of urban life and the rise of an urban-adapted environment in and beyond city boundaries. Here, we report a 6000-year record of environmental changes around the port city of Akko (Acre), Israel, to analyse ecological processes and patterns stemming from the emergence and growth of urban life. We show that early urban development deeply transformed pre-existing ecosystems, swiftly leading to an urban environment already governed by its own ecological rules and this, since the emergence of the cities.},

The purpose of the IGA is to identify the main issues that should be deliberated, rather than to choose among the alternatives. An application of this approach in the Jerusalem District shows that while this approach is readily applicable, it will not lead to more meaningful deliberations in the absence of a suitable institutional context and planning culture.},

Rather, they were equally determined to create a setting appropriate to their regional, national, and even international reputations, as well as to advance the idea that an educational, medical, and cultural district could help reposition and rebrand a sagging industrial city. To do so, institutional leaders sought to make University Circle a bulwark against urban problems, which endeared them to suburbanites while constraining their relations with surrounding urban neighborhoods.},

Planners need better information on the underlying forces that lead to conversion of industrial land and an assessment of the effectiveness of preservation policies. We develop here an index of vulnerability of industrial land that is based on location factors, neighborhood dynamics, detailed industrial trends, environmental hazards, and local regulations. We show how these factors can explain the probability of the conversion of industrial land to other uses in Cook County (IL) and Mecklenburg County (NC) and describe how various industrial preservation polices are effective in limiting conversion. Takeaway for practice: Cities can use this index to strategically plan for industries to target and sites to preserve as industrial uses. Traditional planning and regulatory tools such as industrial zone designations do reduce conversion risk, while factors such as transit accessibility increase the probability of conversion. We argue that local governments should be strategic about which manufacturing industries can be preserved at what locations using these tools. We also develop and demonstrate an open source, interactive, web-based tool that demonstrates some of the key concepts that can be replicated in other places.},

Prior work shows that the presence of clusters creates externalities that improve regional performance. The authors extend that work by developing a framework to examine the role of clusters of related industries on job creation in the inner city. Unique data sets from the Initiative for a Competitive Inner City and from the U.S. Cluster Mapping Project are utilized to analyze the relationship between the strength of a regional cluster and the employment growth of inner-city industries during 2003 to 2011. The authors find that the initial strength of the cluster in the inner city, in the proximate city, and in the rest of the metropolitan statistical area are positively associated with employment growth within the inner-city cluster.},

She provided clean tenements for London's poor that generated a modest profit for her first investor, social philosopher John Ruskin. Hill's success depended on regular personal contact with tenants and insistence on prompt rent payment. The migration of Hill's system from British roots to American soil involved a network of settlement house workers in which Ruskin, the settlement movement's originator, played a central role. American histories of housing reform often identify Lawrence Veiller's Tenement House Exhibition of 1899 as a milestone, and American settlement house histories typically feature Jane Addams and Chicago's Hull House. The purpose of this article is to highlight, and identify connections among, lesser known other settlement pioneers who fought for British and U.S. housing reform. The article describes Hill's philosophy, documents how it reached the United States, and illustrates how Hill, Henrietta Barnett, and Vida Scudder significantly contributed to the production and dissemination of housing reform ideas.},

The actors in focus are mainly the planners (representing the authoritative aspects of planning and city management) and the residents of the city (those who enjoy or are adversely affected by different planning visions and projects). Planners mainly use their professional knowledge, which they obtained from formal education. Residents built up their perceptions and images of the city in a more intuitive way, from their daily routine practices in the city. Following this, the article explores the intricate and sometimes complicated relations between the various types of knowledge involved in the planning process with the aim to find out whose perceptions of the city are incorporated in the planning processes. Focusing on knowledge as a base for formulating cityscapes stems from a personal position and experience as planners, as members of a planning team, nominated by the Tel Aviv Municipality to devise a `new strategic plan' for the Central Bus Station (CBS) area in the city. The article begins with a short introductory background, describing the social and economic situation of Jewish residences and non-Jewish labour migrants of the CBS area in Tel Aviv. It then outlines some theoretical frameworks regarding the different perceptions of this area by the different `actors' involved in its production. The article concludes with some insights regarding the ways that globalizing cities are planned and managed.},

Prior geographic studies largely restricted analysis of the source of intermetropolitan wage disparities to differences in industrial structure. The study described in this article further expands the analysis of labor market effects by conceptually describing and empirically analyzing the effects of three significant racial labor market institutions: public employment, unionization, and the penal system. I investigate these effects as part of a more extensive analysis of how local labor market structure\textemdash{}comprised of industrial mix, demographic composition, and institutional and regulatory arrangements\textemdash{}matters in mediating racial wage inequality. I use data from the 2000 U.S. Census and multilevel methods to analyze the wage differentials of African American and native- and foreign-born Latino men relative to whites across 186 U.S. metropolitan areas. Local labor market structure mediates different types of racial wage inequality in distinct ways: Regulatory context matters most for the relative wages of African Americans; both regulatory context and industrial mix influence the relative wages of native-born Latinos; and industrial composition matters most for the relative wages of foreign-born Latinos. Against these broad patterns of difference, not all effects\textemdash{}especially regulatory and institutional effects\textemdash{}are singularly group specific. Unionization shores up wages for both white and black high school\textendash{}educated workers and mitigates racial wage inequality. Higher minimum wage rates boost the relative wages of high school\textendash{}educated whites and native-born Latinos.},

  doi = {10.2307/40663033},
  abstract = {In cities around the country, huge swaths of property in desirable locations house only empty warehouses, barely-used shipping facilities, and heavily subsidized industrial-age factories, often right across the street from high-end condos and office buildings. The reason is a widely-used, but poorly understood form of local industrial policy known as non-cumulative zoning. In contrast with traditional Euclidean zoning, in which manufacturing uses were prohibited in residential areas but not vice versa, areas that are zoned non-cumulatively allow only manufacturing uses and bar any residential (and sometimes even commercial uses) of property. The arguments for non-cumulative zoning are always the same: Cities seek to (a) reduce the degree to which urban manufacturers are held responsible for nuisance and (b) subsidize urban manufacturing by reducing the competition for land and hence reducing the price. In this Article, we argue that non-cumulative zoning is an idea whose time has passed, if there ever was a convincing case for it at all. The two major justifications for non-cumulative zoning are flawed, and alternative means could achieve the same ends with fewer costs. The large number of nuisance claims engendered by urban manufacturing could be addressed by creating a "right to stink" in certain zones, allowing residential and commercial users to move into these zones but prohibiting them from suing manufacturers who are not violating regulatory laws. As for the second manufacturer-subsidizing justification, subsidies cannot be justified in terms of a subsidizing city's own welfare unless the external "agglomeration" benefits of manufacturing exceed the cost of the subsidy to the city. Moreover, the broader social perspective also requires that some cities are better able to capture those agglomeration benefits than others, meaning that competition between jurisdictions could result in total increases in wealth. However, non-cumulative zoning is unlikely to achieve either local or broader social efficiency. Its scope is not closely tied to any theory of external benefit; it encourages the inefficient use of land and the substitution of land for other inputs; and it hides the true cost of urban manufacturing subsidies from the public. If urban manufacturing must be subsidized, a direct cash subsidy system would be preferable, particularly if it could be funded directly from taxes on the increased value of land caused by the removal of a non-cumulative zoning designation.},

This paper explores the evolution of G2G planning: how external forces within the broader institutional system were interpreted and embodied in the strategic actions of various collaborative actors. Significant legal changes coalesced with an unstable timber market to fundamentally alter the discursive and political terrain of British Columbian natural resource planning. New coalitions and alliances were formed, and previously held conventions regarding both the process and outcomes of planning were challenged. These changes are analysed through the Institutional Capacity Development Framework, which frames institutional change as a measure of actors' ability to mobilise existing and emergent institutional resources. As one of the few empirical studies to apply the framework, this paper proposes several modifications to improve its conceptual clarity and to underscore the importance of changing political identities.},

A current explanatory approach argues that decentralization from large urban areas to mid-sized and small-sized towns is the only process now active and that the basic variables of this interurban decentralization are city size and proximity to or distance from a large urban area. This article provides a theoretical discussion, methodological recommendations and evidence for the argument that industrial decentralization processes are more complex than this and require less restrictive suppositions. Our analysis of new industries located in Zaragoza, one of the main Spanish urban areas, from 1992 to 2005 shows how two aspects, which are seldom found in the literature, influence these processes. The first is the structure of the urban system, because the distance-sensitive decentralization process is contingent on the spatial structure of the system. The second aspect is the industrial and urban development policies, because they can alter the competitive advantages of the different types of cities. Thus, large urban areas can maintain their industrial attractiveness because they meet different and more numerous requirements than the predictions suggested they would and because they halt the spatial advance of the industrial decentralization processes. The article concludes with a reflection on the theoretical and methodological implications of the results as well as their contributions to a better understanding, formulation and analysis of the interurban industrial dynamic.},

  abstract = {This study measures and compares the impact of publicly assisted brownfield redevelopment on nearby residential property values in Milwaukee and Minneapolis. It also examines the influence of land use, neighborhood characteristics, and other redevelopment factors on this impact. The research approach incorporates a hedonic method to quantify nearby property value effects at more than 100 brownfield projects, and stakeholder interviews are used to assess perceived impacts to real estate conditions. The results reveal that the spillover effect in terms of raising surrounding property values is significant in both quantity and geographic scope, as redevelopment led to a net increase of 11.4\% in nearby housing prices in Milwaukee and 2.7\% in Minneapolis. It also reveals that project size, value, and the amount of public funding have minor impacts on this effect; factors such as proximity to major roads, distance from rail, and higher incomes have greater positive impacts.},

  doi = {10.1177/0739456X07299844},
  abstract = {A prominent part of current debates on sprawl involves the relationship between schools and communities. Two key questions on this issue are to what extent considerations about community growth and development influence school boards as they decide, first, whether to renovate an existing school or build new and second, if building new, whether to site the new school in an urban or exurban location. Research on these questions to date has relied largely on case study or anecdotal analysis and has yielded a variety of recommended policy reforms. This paper presents the results of a systematic statewide study of local school board decision making in Michigan. Based primarily on a survey of school district superintendents and a parallel survey of local government officials, along with review of demographic data and selected local plans, the study was designed to test a number of assertions commonly made in the literature about factors influencing school board decision making. The findings suggest that school boards, in general, are influenced most by a sense of competition with neighboring districts and by shifting demographics. Moreover, little meaningful coordination is occurring between school districts and local governments, largely because of the institutional arrangements that shape the school board decision-making process.},

  abstract = {Dissensus: On Politics and Aesthetics~brings together some of Jacques Ranci{\`e}re's most recent writings on art and politics to show the critical potential of two of his most important concepts: the aesthetics of politics and the politics of aesthetics. In this fascinating collection, Ranci{\`e}re engages in a radical critique of some of his major contemporaries on questions of art and politics: Gilles Deleuze, Antonio Negri, Giorgio Agamben, Alain Badiou and Jacques Derrida. The essays show how Ranci{\`e}re's ideas can be used to analyse contemporary trends in both art and politics, including the events surrounding 9/11, war in the contemporary consensual age, and the ethical turn of aesthetics and politics. Ranci{\`e}re elaborates new directions for the concepts of politics and communism, as well as the notion of what a politics of art' might be. This important collection includes several essays that have never previously been published in English, as well as a brand new afterword. Together these essays serve as a superb introduction to the work of one of the world's most influential contemporary thinkers.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to assess the possible contribution of an input\textendash{}output model towards two of the basic principles of the sustainability strategy of integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) and Post-Normal Science. According to these principles, decision-support tools should offer a holistic perspective and handle high uncertainty. The difficulties in reaching sustainability are due partly to the prevailing use of ``narrow-system-boundary'' tools that are non-holistic. Consequently, they fail to capture important ecosystem services and ignore interdependencies between them. To comply with the basic principles, our method allows environmental assets to be evaluated in multiple units and integrates results from recent researches in natural sciences. Both enable coverage of interdependencies between ecosystem services. Thereby, we enlarge input\textendash{}output modelling from the two conventional ecosystem services of sink and provisioning to the most vital ones: the supporting services. An application to the Seine estuary addresses the impacts of maritime transportation infrastructures on nursery habitats for commercial fish. The ecosystem services covered are life support and resource provisioning. Our results show that the restoration of a total of 73.7 km2 of nursery areas over the period 2004\textendash{}2015 would result in a stock of sole in 2015 that exceeds the ``business as usual'' scenario by 44.2\% (uncertainty range: 35.9\%\textendash{}69.9\%). In spite of high restoration costs, the negative macro-economic impact is very low. However, on the sector level, a trade-off results between nurseries and three economic sectors. The quantification of such trade-offs in our model is particularly useful to public participation in decision-making.},

This paper addresses the issue of community participation in the context of the English planning system, which has recently been restructured to focus more sharply on integrating communities in the planning process. It presents findings of research into the workings of the reformed planning system, in particular in relation to the objective of public participation, using the case of the Planning Aid service. The paper sets the discussion in the context of two different forms of democracy (representative and deliberative democracy) and associated strategies for participation. It then outlines the recent reforms in the planning system, highlighting the different approaches to participation that are being applied. The paper then examines the case of Planning Aid, a service that aims to involve disadvantaged groups in the planning system. The paper concludes that the outcomes from recent experiences of participation in planning are in part due to the ``hybrid'' approaches that are emerging within the system. While this provides the potential for more inclusive planning, it is argued that this ``hybridity'' needs to be acknowledged by policy makers and practitioners if strategies and mechanisms are to be put in place that respond to the demands of different forms of democracy.},

Drawing on the experience of the heartlands of neoliberal discursive production, North America and Western Europe, it is argued that the transformative and adaptive capacity of this far\textendash{}reaching political\textendash{}economic project has been repeatedly underestimated. Amongst other things, this calls for a close reading of the historical and geographical (re)constitution of the process of neoliberalization and of the variable ways in which different ``local neoliberalisms'' are embedded within wider networks and structures of neoliberalism. The paper's contribution to this project is to establish a stylized distinction between the destructive and creative moments of the process of neoliberalism\textemdash{}which are characterized in terms of ``roll\textendash{}back'' and ``roll\textendash{}out'' neoliberalism, respectively\textemdash{}and then to explore some of the ways in which neoliberalism, in its changing forms, is playing a part in the reconstruction of extralocal relations, pressures, and disciplines.},

  abstract = {The New Deal for Communities (NDC) programme was one of the most intensive area-based initiatives (ABIs) ever launched in England. Between 1998 and 2010, 39 NDC partnerships were charged with implementing 10-year, locally informed strategies designed to improve conditions within deprived neighbourhoods each accommodating around 9,800 people. More than any other previous English ABI, the NDC programme placed a strong emphasis on informing and engaging the 39 local communities in all aspects of the regeneration process. The programme can be seen as a laboratory within which to assess relationships between community involvement in regeneration and any associated outcomes. Change data indicates that at the area-level there is nothing to suggest NDC areas saw more change than other deprived localities, or that NDCs doing more in relation to the community dimension saw greater change than those doing less. Data showing change for individuals, however, reveals that those involved in NDC activities saw more gains than those who were not involved. This positive individual-level change is not reflected in area-level data because absolute levels of involvement remained essentially low. This was for a number of reasons, some of which relate to the evolving NDC narrative: greater control from central government, diminishing community interest in the initiative, and over-optimistic assumptions on the part of local residents as to what the programme could ever achieve.},

This paper examines the challenges local governments face in creating age-friendly physical-social environments. Findings from a recent study of local government and ageing in New South Wales, Australia and subsequent research are reported. The analysis reveals that local councils have differing abilities to provide age-friendly local infrastructure. Challenges are greater overall for regional, rural and fringe councils compared to metropolitan. Timely provision is greatly constrained by insufficient resources, the large scale of the task and the low priority accorded, despite the immediate need for action. A pressing requirement is demonstrated for local councils to give primacy to population ageing in their long-term strategic, asset and financial planning, and to engage in reform measures to assist in financing the cost.},

That legislation was strengthened in I988, but throughout the 1990s, no study examined whether these tougher strictures helped eliminate steering. In 2000, HUD and the Urban Institute conducted the national Housing Discrimination Study in 20 U.S. metropolitan areas to replicate and extend that earlier work. In this article, we report the results of this latest study, which examined three types of steering and three steering mechanisms, all at three geographic scales. The results indicate that steering of all types is occur- ring when Black and White homebuyers are involved. In at least 12 to 15\% of the cases, agents provided gratuitous commentary that gave more information to White homebuyers and encouraged them to choose homes in areas with more White and fewer poor households. Steering is less prevalent when Hispanic and White buyers are involved. We also found no evidence that steering declined over the last decade, despite the toughening of the federal legislation in 1988. We conclude by discussing the implications for interracial wealth differentials and new fair housing enforcement initiatives.},

We also examine the influences of individual urban design features and find that residents prefer entrances that face the street, and facades constructed from the same material as adjacent buildings. They also prefer parking in front of their homes, and to be buffered from public streets. We interpret the former to be preferences for greater integration into the surrounding neighbourhood, consistent with our findings on infill.},

This turn of events is evident in two further aspects of urbanization processes at the present time. First, a new division of labor is strongly under way with major implications for the restratification of urban labor markets and urban social life. Second, the economic and social transformations currently evident in large urban areas are provoking significant changes in the physical milieu and built form of the city, from gentrification to what I call aestheticized land use intensification. I attempt to synthesize important elements of the discussion by means of a disquisition on the city and the world, in which I point to some of the more outstanding institutional failures within the current system of neoliberal local\textendash{}global development.},

We found a 5\% increase in walkability to be associated with a per capita 32.1\% increase in time spent in physically active travel, a 0.23-point reduction in body mass index, 6.5\% fewer vehicle miles traveled, 5.6\% fewer grams of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emitted, and 5.5\% fewer grams of volatile organic compounds (VOC) emitted. These results connect development patterns with factors that affect several prevalent chronic diseases.},

A review of national policy guidance and planning law indicates that central government is taking an equivocal stance towards gender.

It is increasingly recognized that this integration is needed at both the national and the local levels of governance. The Environmental Policy Integration (EPI) principle agreed upon in a number of international and EU commitments is receiving the attention of more urban planning scholars. The EPI phenomenon is underresearched, and in many countries, its implementation, particularly subnationally as in urban planning, is hindered by organizational and administrative weaknesses. This article seeks to show how a communicative approach can be used to improve EPI in the urban planning context, based on a literature review of organization theory and communicative planning. The review sheds light on the relevance of the communicative approach to EPI by comparing it with existing EPI approaches. The authors conclude that a communicative approach to EPI is potentially illuminating in changing organizational structures and how individual actors interact in urban planning processes.},

  abstract = {Regional planning has long sought to manage places that extend across political boundaries. The international trend to decentralize governance and promote co-management of protected areas is consistent with emerging collaborative spatial planning theory (Healey, 1997, 1999, 2006), which suggests that through dialogue, parties assert multiple cultural perspectives, share knowledge, and forge shared landscape values as the basis of decisions. As a form of collaborative spatial planning, co-management specifies shared resource management power between national government and one or more local or indigenous communities. Both approaches assume decentralized governance systems. Although critics fault collaborative planning for glossing over historical and cultural contexts, and for ignoring power in decision making, few case studies ask why partners participate or how specific decentralized governance institutions affect plan implementation. This paper draws from a study of co-management at Mount Pulag National Park, the Philippines\textemdash{}a shared indigenous cultural landscape that was to be managed by a board representing multiple local, indigenous, and national jurisdictions. Tracing road decisions by two municipal partners, the paper summarizes how and why major stakeholders adopted and then circumvented protective policies by building duplicative road projects across fragile forests. In this context of changing indigenous rights, the same decentralization laws that enabled co-management also rewarded competition and strategic behavior that weakened the collaborative and fragmented the shared landscape. The case demonstrates the need to interrogate, rather than assume the benefits of decentralized governance and to study why stakeholders participate before relying on voluntary collaboration to manage regional landscapes. The initial version of this paper was presented to the 2006 annual meetings of the Association of Collegiate Schools of Planning, Fort Worth, Texas.},

This study evaluates the event's effectiveness using democratic principles. The program was successful at reaching huge numbers in a short time period, at being inspiring, at increasing political efficacy, and at creating networks. It fell short, however, where the medium of television is inherently undemocratic (in the timing and scheduling of the show and engagement, in expense, and in reinforcing passivity). Comparing the strengths and weaknesses of television reveals that planners can use television to its best participatory advantage when they focus on collaborative participation and when they have realistic expectations.},

  abstract = {Financialization is a key attribute of globalized neoliberal capitalism. Among other things, it is associated with rising household indebtedness, which has certainly been true in Canada. Another widely recognized trait of neoliberal capitalism is growing social inequality and polarization. However, despite growing awareness and understanding of the relationships between debt and inequality at the household, national, and international scales, it remains unclear what role household debt may have in fashioning patterns of income segregation within the metropolis and how it may be related to processes of urban economic restructuring. This article seeks to fill this gap through an empirical analysis of the spatial distribution of household debt and its relationship to prevailing patterns of neighborhood income inequality within Canadian metropolitan areas. The effects of household debt in either ameliorating or exacerbating prevailing levels of income segregation are analyzed, after which the metropolitan-level factors that are associated with regressive neighborhood distributions of debt are examined. The implications of the results for understanding the relationship between financialization and predominant patterns of urban economic restructuring are then discussed.},

While the initiatives illustrate the potential for community transformation by integrating sustainability and the social economy, they also illustrate the challenges associated with an incremental approach to change in the context of competition with mainstream economic activities that are heavily subsidized and do not account for negative social, economic and environmental externalities.},

Results indicate that a dasymetric model yields lower accessibility scores than a standard pro rata model. More important, the difference is spatially disproportionate, suggesting that the degree of disadvantage experienced in rural areas may be greater than has previously been recognized.},

Using die Mauer (The Berlin Wall) as a linking metaphor, this article juxtaposes mid-1950s planning in a spatially- and ideologically-divided Berlin (Germany) against Harland Bartholomew's mid-1950s planning in a racially-divided Louisville, Kentucky (USA). It then juxtaposes the latter against a mid-1950s narrative about efforts to desegregate housing in Louisville. This juxtaposition reveals that some people in Louisville used the Cold War divide between East and West to reinforce the long-standing racial divide between blacks and whites. Moreover, it reveals that, by deferring to Cold War-related racial politics that could not be questioned, Bartholomew's technical approach to planning silenced other voices of reason and thereby reflected and reproduced the race-inflected politics of the Cold War divide. The article concludes by briefly considering what Bartholomew might have done differently in the context and by exploring what this juxtaposition of stories implies for planning in the context of the contemporary `war against terrorists'.},

  abstract = {Problem: Human and natural systems will probably have to adapt to climate change impacts, but this cannot be planned for using the traditional approach based on predictions because of the subject's great complexity, its planning horizon more than 50 years away, and uncertainty about the future climate and how effectively CO2 emissions will be reduced. Purpose: This article proposes a more appropriate basis for planning climate change adaptation. Anticipatory governance is a flexible decision framework that uses a wide range of possible futures to prepare for change and to guide current decisions toward maximizing future alternatives or minimizing future threats. Rather than trying to tame or ignore uncertainty, this approach explores uncertainty and its implications for current and future decision making. Methods: I review and summarize the literature on anticipatory governance and provide three case studies to demonstrate its application to climate change planning. Results and conclusions: Denver Water, New York City, and the City of Phoenix are all using scenarios to anticipate the range of global climate changes that may impact their communities and to develop adaptation strategies to address these impacts. Each is developing a decision framework for implementing adaptation strategies incrementally based on climate monitoring. An incremental approach minimizes the resources that must be allocated to address these risks and has allowed these cities to plan in spite of the high uncertainty associated with climate change science and social change. Takeaway for practice: The complexity, uncertainty, and distant planning horizon associated with climate change cannot be managed sufficiently for the traditional predict-and-plan approach to yield good decisions about the significant social and capital investments likely to be required for adaptation. To be successful, social institutions must embrace new methods that explore uncertainty and that provide strategic guidance for current and future decisions. Research support: None.},

Results indicate that transportation mismatch is the more important factor in generating poor labor-market outcomes, particularly for disadvantaged neighborhoods. Areas with relatively more jobs increase female employment rates but not male employment rates. On the other hand, lower car ownership rates significantly decrease the employment ratio and increase the unemployment rate for both sexes.},

After all, multi-level governance is already thought to refer to the interaction between nested territorial administrations. So could multi-level governance be criticised for giving more attention to the roles and positions of lower-levels in a multi-level polity rather than invoking a comprehensive concept of governance implicating non-governmental actors in policy making? And does the multi-level governance literature ignore the underlying metageography? Whether territories are accordingly fixed jurisdictions or malleable social constructs has implications for planning and beyond.},

This article looks at some recent literature \textemdash{} both scholarly and popular \textemdash{} and considers the reasons why the often highly critical perspectives on gentrification that we saw in earlier decades have dwindled. Whilst a number of reasons could be put forward, three in particular are discussed. First, the resilience of theoretical and ideological squabbles over the causes of gentrification, at the expense of examining its effects; second, the demise of displacement as a defining feature of the process and as a research question; and third, the pervasive influence of neoliberal urban policies of `social mix' in central city neighbourhoods. It is argued that the `eviction' of critical perspectives from a field in which they were once plentiful has serious implications for those at risk from gentrification, and that reclaiming the term from those who have sugarcoated what was not so long ago a `dirty word' (Smith, 1996) is essential if political challenges to the process can be effective.},

They assume that local plans will provide meaningful policy guidance to local officials when making land use-related policy decisions, and that local officials will implement their plans. This article presents findings from an evaluation of state-mandated local planning in coastal North Carolina during the mid 1990s. All 20 coastal counties and 72. municipalities were preparing plans consistent with the state's procedural requirements during this time, and many were using those plans to at least some extent when making land use-related policy decisions. Taken altogether, however, the plans were weak analytically and substantively, providing limited guidance for growth management, especially in terms of coastal area resource protection. The promise of state-mandated local planning for managing growth at the regional level is discussed in light of North Carolina's experiences.},

We use longitudinal data from the MTO program to assess the role of transportation\textemdash{}automobiles and improved access to public transit\textemdash{}in moving to, and maintaining, employment. We use multi-nomial logistic regression to predict changes in employment status as a function of change in automobile availability and transit accessibility, controlling for other potential determinants of employment. We find that keeping or gaining access to an automobile is positively related to the likelihood of employment. Improved access to public transit is positively associated with maintaining employment, but not with job gains. Although we cannot say for certain whether car ownership preceded or followed employment, it is clear that having a car provides multiple benefits that facilitate getting and keeping a job. Takeaway for practice:Policies to increase automobile access among low-income households\textemdash{}even in dense urban areas\textemdash{}will most clearly enhance job gain and job retention. While auto programs are unpopular with many planners, they would improve the lives of low-income families who currently have the least access to cars. In addition, supporting moves to transit-rich neighborhoods may help households maintain consistent employment.},

Nonetheless, the Tornagrain case raises non-trivial questions about this model, not least the faith being placed in a globally mobile policy evangelist becoming, in effect, a doctrinal conduit for convening local democracy. The paper then contributes to recent debate on post-political planning, particularly in terms of how latent expressions of dissent in local planning processes often appear to be deamplified through endeavours to forge a post-political consensus, in part to masquerade rent hikes and profiteering on behalf of powerful landowners, glitzy architects, consultants and other associates.},

The model is then applied to the Master Plan of Amman, Jordan where planners from Toronto, Canada have been involved. The analysis reveals that during their interpersonal transactions, the transfer agents are better able to synthesize and adapt the transferred theories and practices than when the transfer process progresses toward the institutional level. The findings also reveal the significance of a structure that is conducive to the transfer agents for the synthesis and adaptation of knowledge.},

Drawing on comprehensive data from over one million blood tests administered to Chicago children from 1995-2013 and matched to over 2300 geographic block groups, we address two major questions: (1) What is the nature of the relationship between neighborhood-level racial composition and variability in children's elevated lead prevalence levels? And (2) what is the nature of the relationship between neighborhood-level racial composition and rates of change in children's prevalence levels over time within neighborhoods? We further assess an array of structural explanations for observed racial disparities, including socioeconomic status, type and age of housing, proximity to freeways and smelting plants, and systematic observations of housing decay and neighborhood disorder. Overall, our theoretical framework posits lead toxicity as a major environmental pathway through which racial segregation has contributed to the legacy of Black disadvantage in the United States. Our findings support this hypothesis and show alarming racial disparities in toxic exposure, even after accounting for possible structural explanations. At the same time, however, our longitudinal results show the power of public health policies to reduce racial inequities.},

  abstract = {Using mixed-methods--spatial analysis, regression modeling, and historical evidence--this dissertation explains the origins and impact of Los Angeles's slow-growth movement between the Watts (1965) and Rodney King (1992) civil unrests. Part planning history and part land use analysis, the dissertation explores how land use policy both impacts, and is impacted by, social, economic, and environmental forces through the machinations of local politics. As such, it provides a detailed empirical case study of the relationship between democracy, social capital, and urban planning.
The dissertation explains how the slow-growth movement was facilitated by the shift from top-down planning during the pro-growth, post-war period to a bottom-up community planning process post-Watts. The project illustrates the land use changes adopted after Watts, changes that were correlated with socio-economic characteristics and homeowner activity. Areas with well-organized homeowner groups dramatically decreased density as a means of controlling population growth, thus directing the future growth of L.A. to predominately low-income, minority communities--communities least able to accommodate that growth due to overcrowded housing, under-performing schools, limited park space and, in many cases, poor transit access. In short, density was directed to the path of least political resistance, a social injustice that exacerbated spatial disparities between communities.
In addition to mapping and regression analysis, the findings are illustrated by three historical group case studies (L.A. Urban League, L.A. Area Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Hillside and Canyon Associations) and two place case studies (Baldwin Hills/Crenshaw and Woodland Hills/Canoga Park). The cases illustrate the motivations and impact of civil rights, business, and homeowner groups, and how land use changes transformed two areas of the city in very different ways.
The homeowner revolution in Los Angeles--and its damaging impacts on the City's social, economic, and environmental sustainability--demonstrates the need for the re-assertion of a professional role for planners, a better balance between local and regional concerns, and the critical importance of implementing a planning process that reflects the will of the majority of a City's residents, rather than empower only its most strident voices.},

The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 requires all states to prepare mitigation plans. Based on six principles of plan quality, we content analyzed a sample of 30 coastal state plans to determine how well they support mitigation. Findings indicate that although plans scored moderate to low for all plan quality principles, plan quality has modestly improved over the past decade. In addition, some states scored low for one principle, which can undermine implementation of otherwise high-scoring plans for the remaining principles. Recommendations are offered on how plan quality evaluation can be used to guide and monitor state development of hazard mitigation plans.},

Results revealed that the spatial assessment of footprints and intensities of human activities had more influence on landscape vulnerabilities than the type of landscape sensitivity measure used. We addressed questions regarding consequences of potential planning targets, and necessary management measures with spatially-explicit assessment of their consequences. We conclude that the BN\textendash{}GIS framework is a practical tool allowing for the visualisation of relationships, the spatial assessment of uncertainty related to spatial management scenarios, the engagement of different stakeholder views, and enables a quick update of new spatial data and relationships. Ultimately, such BN\textendash{}GIS based tools can support the decision-making process used in adaptive marine management.},

We present data on socioeconomic and ethnic disparities in asthma prevalence and morbidity in the United States and discuss environmental factors contributing to asthma disparities (e.g., housing conditions, indoor environmental exposures including allergens, traffic air pollution, disparities in treatment and access to care, and cigarette smoking). We discuss environmental influences on somatic growth (low birth weight, prematurity, and obesity) and their relevance to asthma disparities. The relevance of the hygiene hypothesis to the U.S. urban situation is reviewed. Finally, we discuss community-level factors contributing to asthma disparities.},

  abstract = {Problem: Although planners aim to provide for income diversity in the communities they serve, too little is known about how income distributions in metropolitan neighborhoods are changing. Purpose: We investigate whether neighborhood income diversity has increased since 1970 by examining neighborhoods in the 100 largest U.S. metropolitan areas. Methods: We analyze neighborhoods in the 100 largest U.S. metropolitan areas from 1970 to 2000 using a combination of nominal (H) and ordinal (E) entropy indices. We focus on neighborhoods we call bipolar, (where E/H $>$ 1), in which very low- and very high-income groups predominate. We investigate these with tract-level statistics and by using a counterfactual. Results and conclusions: We find a dramatic increase in the number and incidence of these bipolars since 1970. Compared to other neighborhoods, we find that, on average, bipolars have significantly greater shares of very high-income families, racial diversity, shares of middle-aged persons, and shares of renters. We use a counterfactual to reveal that much of the growth in bipolars over the last three decades has been fueled by income distributions at the metropolitan scale becoming more bimodal, with fewer middle-income families. Gentrification appears to explain only a minor share of growth in bipolars. Takeaway for practice: Metropolitan census tracts with pronounced bimodal income distributions have become more common since 1970. This appears to reflect changing metropolitan income distributions more than spatial rearrangement, although planning policies may be responsible in some instances. Whether residence in bipolar neighborhoods will benefit very low-income households by reducing stereotyping and expanding social opportunities is unclear, but such places should be monitored.},

These efforts to diversify the city's steel economy through heritage tourism reflect an early convergence of urban renewal and historic preservation that local leaders termed historic renewal.

This study made a direct comparison of the two methods for the public transit system in the Phoenix, Arizona, metropolitan area. The results indicated that although both sources were acceptable for FTA compliance, the use of one or the other could affect whether a proposed service change was deemed equitable. In other words, the outcome of a service change equity analysis could differ as a result of the data source used. To ensure the integrity and meaning of such analyses, FTA should recommend the collection and use of ridership data for conducting service change analyses to supplement approaches that are based on census data.},

Overall, the history of the project demonstrates that continuity exists between a philosophy of slum clearance urban renewal and current urban planning thinking. Additionally, Battery Park shows how planners sought to remake financial districts at a time of urban crisis.},

It has been assumed that it will widen the knowledge base behind decisions by bringing local, first-hand knowledge into planning. However, what type of knowledge will be generated by such a geographically referenced public discussion in the planning process? This article addresses this question by tracing how an online discussion that allowed spatial annotations was implemented in a real-life land-use planning process in Tampere, Finland. The analysis focuses on two distinct phases of knowledge production. First, discussion focuses on how establishing this particular technology as a public forum impacts on the type of knowledge that is provided by the participants. The second part of the study addresses how planners assimilate information from geo-referenced public discussion. The article suggests that the interplay between (1) the site of knowledge production that was at the same time the arena of public discussion, (2) the issues that were deemed necessary to be cared for publicly, and (3) the people who were willing and able to enter the public arena and address issues in the way that the public arena afforded was crucial in shaping the type of knowledge that was generated. Furthermore, the results suggest that the constraints set by the local planning procedures and practical work of planners effectively guide the transformation of this knowledge into the domain of planning. The article starts to unravel contingencies of knowledge production related to public participation methods which use online discussion and spatial annotations.},

Responding to these fears, affordable housing advocates have claimed that there is little evidence from studies that have examined this topic to suggest that affordable housing detrimentally affects property values.

This review examines seventeen studies that have attempted to measure the effect of affordable housing on property values to try to answer this question. An analysis of these studies reveals that the extent to which property values are lowered depends on a variety of factors: design and management of affordable housing, compatibility between affordable housing and host neighborhood, and concentration of affordable housing.},

In this article we review recent shifts in the community development field and give examples of programs that operate at the intersection of community development, public health, and civic engagement. For example, in Sacramento, California, the Building Healthy Communities program successfully promoted the creation of community gardens and bike paths and the redevelopment of brownfields. A major housing revitalization initiative in San Francisco, California, known as Sunnydale-Velasco, is transforming the city's largest public housing site into a mixed-income community that provides existing residents with new housing, infrastructure, services, and amenities. These examples and others illustrate the need to identify and make use of interdisciplinary approaches to ensure that all places are strong platforms for economic mobility, full democratic participation, and community health.},

A key challenge is that trends for men and women are in opposite directions and appear to cancel each other out. We clarify this situation by examining trends in employer tenure by sex, marital status, and parental status. We find that married mothers are behind the increase in women's job tenure, but men and never-married women have seen declines in tenure. Furthermore, we show that the timing of tenure trends for women parallels periods of increased labor force attachment. Finally, we find that shifts in industry and occupation composition can account for the decline in tenure among men and never-married women before 1996 but not afterward. We situate these diverging trends in two broad shifts in expectations, norms, and behaviors in the labor market: the end-of-work discourse and the revolution in women's identification with paid work. Our findings support the view that job tenure is declining for all groups, but women's greater labor force attachment, especially their more continuous employment around childbirth, countered and masked this trend.},

Although many scholars have recently begun to critically examine the implementation of these new state initiatives, few have explored their effects on patterns of intraurban land development. In this article, we develop a framework for thinking about the likely effects of state growth management programs on a central city's ability to attract new residential construction activity and investigate this issue using a panel data approach. Multivariate regression results suggest that these programs have observable effects on the spatial distribution of residential construction activity within urban areas. Furthermore, we accept several hypotheses regarding coefficient stability across states, regions, and program designs. These findings suggest that state growth management programs may be an effective tool for promoting the revitalization of central cities.},

  abstract = {Since the 1990s, interest in place (as opposed to space) has surged across a spectrum of social science disciplines including planning. But the empirical focus has been chiefly on cities along the Atlantic Rim even as vast new areas in Asia, Africa, and Latin America were undergoing accelerated urbanization. This essay outlines a planning perspective to global place-making in the face of fierce inter-city competition for footloose capital. The question of how a place can be defined, and what criteria might serve to delineate a place occupies the first part of this essay. The definition proposed encompasses both a physical/built environment at the neighborhood scale and the subjective feelings its inhabitants harbor towards each other as an emplaced community. Specific criteria are discussed, with brief illustrations from Taiwan and China. But the art of place-making has not informed planners of the swaths of the urban in the newly industrializing global regions of Asia and elsewhere. Their principal preoccupation has been with the branding of cities and the advanced infrastructure required by global capital. In the process, millions of ordinary folks have been displaced and their neighborhoods erased, as speed, movement, and power have been valued more than the fragile social infrastructure of place-based communities. The essay concludes with an argument that place-making is everyone's job, local residents as well as official planners, and that old places can be ``taken back'' neighborhood by neighborhood, through collaborative people-centered planning. Examples from Japan, China, and Canada are used to illustrate these propositions.},

This article is an empirical examination of behavioral responses of people to the environmental quality of neighborhood commercial streets. Structured and semistructured observations are used to study stationary, lingering, and social activities on three neighborhood commercial streets. Eleven land use and physical characteristics of buildings and the street are identified based on the literature review and extensive observations. These are measured and tested to understand which characteristics support stationary, lingering, and social activities. The findings reveal that people are equally concerned with the social, land use, and physical aspects of the street. Seating provided by businesses, seating provided by the public authorities, businesses that are community places, personalized street fronts, and sidewalk width particularly contribute to stationary and social activities on neighborhood commercial streets.},

The article takes a first step in this direction by proposing a `clash of rationalities', between techno-managerial and marketised systems of government administration, service provision and planning (in those parts of the world where these apply) and increasingly marginalised urban populations surviving largely under conditions of informality. It draws together theoretical resources beyond the boundaries of conventional planning theory to understand the nature of this conflict, and the nature of the `interface' between those involved, where unpredictable encounter and contestation also open the possibility for exploring alternative approaches to planning.},

Three simulations were built to demonstrate how agent-based models (ABM) can be used to examine and compare people's choices of residential location in response to natural amenities and wildfire policies. This paper investigates the ways in which policy effects are incorporated dynamically into the land development decision-making process at an individual level in a case study area.

In this paper we argue that by remaining wedded to an analysis of labour that is confined to the employment relationship, Labour Process Theory (LPT) has missed a fundamental shift in the location of value production in contemporary capitalism. We examine this shift through the work of Autonomist Marxists like Hardt and Negri, Lazaratto and Arvidsson, who offer theoretical leverage to prize open a new `hidden abode' outside employment, for example in the `production of organization' and in consumption. Although they can open up this new `hidden abode', without LPT's fine-grained analysis of control/resistance, indeterminacy and structured antagonism, these theorists risk succumbing to empirically naive claims about the `new economy'. Through developing an expanded conception of a `new hidden abode' of production, the paper demarcates an analytical space in which both LPT and Autonomist Marxism can expand and develop their understanding of labour and value production in today's economy.},

These concepts are then related to the acquisitions of planning education and professional skill development\textemdash{}what `shapes' the planner? The article suggests that planning practices and decision-making are often constrained by the planner's desire to conform to self-imposed perceptions of professional and societal expectations. These practices contribute to maintenance of the ideological edifices which constitute social reality in that they do not necessarily materialise a planner's own values and beliefs, but rather the beliefs and values which a planner `thinks' that planners are supposed to have and to express in society. The article concludes with a consideration of the implications this has for planning ethics.},

  abstract = {Michael Porter's cluster theory became popular at both the academic and policy levels as well as received a series of critiques. This article provides a synthetic view of those critiques. In addition, it reveals two new fundamental limitations of the theory. First, the descriptive and static nature of the theory limits the ability to replicate a successful cluster in prac- tice. In other words, the current theory is more focused on describing how a cluster is organized today rather than how a cluster emerged. Incorporating historical process can strengthen the practical application. Second, the interconnectedness of a cluster is hard to measure empirically, and moreover, the theory does not explain how exactly the public sector can strengthen this aspect. A dialogue with networking theories can potentially improve the application.},

During the process of writing the plan, ARC staff adapted a large-scale urban model to produce a set of region-wide population, employment, and land-use projections, for a 30-year horizon (1970\textemdash{}2000). The development policies ARC ultimately adopted encouraged the building of a vast, low-density landscape, exactly as the model predicted. A number of participants argued that the model had distorted the process by privileging policies that closely matched its projections of sprawling growth. Yet in spite of its trouble, the model helped ARC establish its legitimacy as a powerful force in the development of metropolitan Atlanta. An examination of the process of writing the 1975 RDP provides a case example of the role of planning technologies in shaping regional planning discourse in the latter part of the twentieth century.},

It is argued that, while there has been increased interest in the role of occupations, little has been done from a methodological and empirical approach to discover how the study of occupations can illuminate the study of industry. Prior work in cluster analysis has generally taken an `either/or' approach towards occupational and industrial analysis. Porter's clustering model has illuminated the cross-fertilising linkages across industries, but this is only half the story. It is argued that what drives these clusters is not only the industry, but also the people and their occupational skills and, therefore, such analysis must be expanded. Using the case of the IT sector in Los Angeles, the industry approach is combined with an `occupational cluster analysis'. It is concluded that this approach leads to a better understanding of regional competitiveness and growth.},

  abstract = {Objective
Examining covariate balance is the prescribed method for determining when propensity score methods are successful at reducing bias. This study assessed the performance of various balance measures, including a proposed balance measure based on the prognostic score (also known as the disease-risk score), to determine which balance measures best correlate with bias in the treatment effect estimate.

Study Design and Setting
The correlations of multiple common balance measures with bias in the treatment effect estimate produced by weighting by the odds, subclassification on the propensity score, and full matching on the propensity score were calculated. Simulated data were used, based on realistic data settings. Settings included both continuous and binary covariates and continuous covariates only.

Results
The standardized mean difference in prognostic scores, the mean standardized mean difference, and the mean t-statistic all had high correlations with bias in the effect estimate. Overall, prognostic scores displayed the highest correlations of all the balance measures considered. Prognostic score measure performance was generally not affected by model misspecification and performed well under a variety of scenarios.

Conclusion
Researchers should consider using prognostic score\textendash{}based balance measures for assessing the performance of propensity score methods for reducing bias in non-experimental studies.},

Students were very likely to come into the classroom with a heightened awareness of social justice concerns, in great part because of the civil rights movement and because of an ``urban crisis'' that may have actually called them into the profession. In the current situation, in which such background and sense of urgency cannot be assumed, it is important to consider ways in which to create classroom learning experiences that foster a sense of social consciousness. Only a limited number of tools exist that can help with this process, however, and each has advantages and disadvantages. Planning history is one of these tools, but it has value only if used carefully and with purposeful preparation on the part of the instructor.},

Based on the theoretical framework, gentrification stage model and adopting discrete-time survival analysis, we separately compare the risks of opening and closing between businesses established before/early stage of revitalisation (early-arrivers) and those established in the later stage (late-arrivers) within West Chelsea, versus their counterparts in the remainder of the study area in New York. We find that West Chelsea has been an advantageous location overall for late-arrivers in surviving in their market, while the early-arrived gallery and individual artists' enterprises have faced a higher risk of their operations closing. On the other hand, a higher proportion of new gallery and arts and cultural industries remain attracted to West Chelsea after 2000, suggesting that firms in those industries may be benefiting from the agglomeration effects and localisation economies associated with colocation. The higher opening probability of lodging venues (e.g. hotels) and other amenities signals an overall transformation of the neighbourhood and influx of new uses (and visitors) observed during this time frame.},

Specifically, it reviews case studies in the implementation of environmentally protected area (APA) policy at the local level in the state of Bahia, Brazil. The state created various APAs with the expectation that local actors would support the policy enforcement regimes, thereby reducing the need for a dramatic increase in state institutional capacity. As it turned out, local actors provided varying levels of support for the range of enforcement responsibilities. Based on empirical research conducted in seven APAs, this article identifies three principal factors that explain higher engagement by local actors: (1) the objective of the policy intervention at the local level, (2) the number of different localities involved in the same project or program, and (3) the timing of the involvement of local actors in the policy-making and implementation processes.},

While these TNCs broadly conform to a loosely coordinated decentralized or multinational organisational model, there is significant firm-to-firm, spatial and temporal variability in the internationalization strategies that they employ, deriving from both the breadth of the industry \textendash{} i.e. the range of different staffing activities that it encompasses \textendash{} and the inherently territorially-embedded nature of staffing industry activity. These complexities are exemplified through consideration, in turn, of the scope of staffing TNCs, their foreign direct investment strategies, levels of central coordination, and degrees of standardization. The analysis demonstrates that, due to the need to respond to markets, temporary staffing TNCs exhibit highly spatially and temporally variable internationalization strategies and there are considerable barriers to both the centralization of control and the standardization of business practices.},

  abstract = {We study the long run effects of one of the most ambitious regional development programs in U.S. history: the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Using as controls authorities that were proposed but never approved by Congress, we find that the TVA led to large gains in agricultural employment that were eventually reversed when the program's subsidies ended. Gains in manufacturing employment, by contrast, continued to intensify well after federal transfers had lapsed - a pattern consistent with the presence of agglomeration economies in manufacturing. Because manufacturing paid higher wages than agriculture, this shift raised aggregate income in the TVA region for an extended period of time. Economists have long cautioned that the local gains created by place based policies may be offset by losses elsewhere. We develop a structured approach to assessing the TVA's aggregate consequences that is applicable to other place based policies. In our model, the TVA affects the national economy both directly through infrastructure improvements and indirectly through agglomeration economies. The model's estimates suggest that the TVA's direct investments yielded a significant increase in national manufacturing productivity, with benefits exceeding the program's costs. However, the program's indirect effects appear to have been limited: agglomeration gains in the TVA region were offset by losses in the rest of the country. Spillovers in manufacturing appear to be the rare example of a localized market failure that cancels out in the aggregate.},

  abstract = {The enlargement of the European Union has triggered the exchange of spatial planning practices between East and West. Particularly on the level of policy instruments, the intervention side of the planning spectrum, Western European experts on spatial planning have been actively exporting their knowledge to the new and candidate member states. This exchange seems logical in the light of the many similarities between the new and the old member states, such as their common history, similar land tenure concepts, spatial characteristics and challenges, and of course the EU context in which governance is embedded. However, there are several pitfalls that may cause the exchange of planning experience to lead to disappointing or even negative results. Four pitfalls are discussed in this article and illustrated with examples from Central European rural development. The first pitfall is the lack of sufficiently clear terminology that frustrates successful export of knowledge. When terms are ill-defined, people may use the same word for very different concepts and consequently, co-operation between countries that may look successful at first may in a later stage be blocked by a serious gap between the perceptions of those involved. Second, the pre-occupation with solutions instead of problem analysis is discussed. In successful export of planning knowledge, the basic question should be one of a strategic nature, namely what is the exact nature of the problem (is it a problem at all?) and what way of intervening may positively change the situation. The third pitfall is the underestimation of the range of context-dependent factors that affect the effectiveness of planning instruments. The article proposes a way of developing appropriate insight into an instrument's context-dependency by clarifying the link between the context and a potentially exportable instrument. The fourth pitfall is the persistent assumption that more recent instruments are better than traditional instruments, with the result that traditional approaches are ignored. It is argued here that instruments do not evolve into ever better instruments, but that they merely change along with the preferences of society.},

Particularly, this article looks at distinctive spatial forms and social and political formations associated with Shanghai before, under, and after the Mao Zedong. By weaving planning history with critical analysis of Chinese sociopolitics, this article chronologically traces the formative history of Shanghai's unique urbanism, building on existing literature and provides a wide coverage of the episodic accounts of Shanghai's planning history. When the role of individuals in the making of Shanghai becomes obvious especially after the reform in the early 1980s, this article pays attention to their roles in the development of Shanghai and the ``power and politics'' they represented, which fostered the resurrection of the city.},

The findings suggest that the automotive industry has a disproportionate impact across Alabama in terms of a series of indicators including gross state product, employment, and household welfare. Benefits accrue primarily to counties in which the auto plants and their suppliers are located. The spillover effects into nonautomotive-plant counties are modest and about evenly distributed. Middle-income households are the largest gainers, and this is true across all counties, including the Black Belt, a region across the South where rural poverty is concentrated. Despite its rapid growth, the auto industry continues to constitute a small fraction of the state's economy (less than 3\% of gross state product). Thus, overdependence on a cyclical industry is as yet not an issue for policy makers.},

The article constructs a typology of these varied institutional settings based on research of nineteen European city-regions. Each type of institutional framework has its particular risks and opportunities, and these need to be taken into account in generating the appropriate form of informal planning strategy and maximum connectivity.},

By rebuilding the link between power and psychology, the research integrates recent work on power structures with research on negotiation skills within the planning discipline. Moreover, this article illustrates that a deeper understanding of human psychology and the dynamics of negotiation enables a planner to choose a more effective mediation strategy.},

In many countries regional disparities are fairly large and persistent. Often classification systems are needed to provide succinct information on these disparities. This paper presents a model-based classification system which is designed to assess labour market conditions which influence the outcomes of active labour market policy. The innovation in this paper is the development of a procedure that combines a theory-guided analysis of determinants of regional disparities with standard classification approaches. The procedure is designed to resolve two limitations inherent in many existing classification schemes: first, their purely descriptive nature and second, the lack of a theoretically meaningful organization of the variable selection process.

The model has two components: coordination of buildings and spaces, and standardization among cities. A variety of coordinated arrangements of buildings reflect urban planning, including simple coordination, formality and monumentality, orthogonal layouts, other forms of geometric order, and access and visibility (view-shed). Standardization among cities is analyzed in terms of architectural inventories, spatial patterns, orientation, and metrology. The political and social significance of ancient urban planning is then discussed using Amos Rapoport's model of levels of meaning in the built environment.},

Nevertheless, the issue of the deterioration of the inner ring suburbs has only recently received significant consideration by urban scholars and policy makers. In this article, the authors review the literature on metropolitan formation and the smart growth movement to critically assess how well it characterizes and explains the evolution of inner ring suburbs, as well as to emphasize the role that inner ring suburbs can play in metropolitan smart growth strategies. They next characterize the literature specifically focused on inner ring suburbs in terms of what it has to offer on defining such areas. After identifying the gaps in the literature, the authors offer a methodology for accurately defining inner ring suburbs and conclude with a discussion of policy for effectively addressing the socioeconomic needs of the inner ring suburbs within the context of metropolitan smart growth.},

The jobless and homeless men in Chicago's vagrancy scale rejected popular censure and criminal sanction. The sex workers who made up Chicago's vice scale resisted vice prohibitions. Like jobless and homeless men, they disaggregated and produced mini scales that defied the efforts of authorities to contain and eliminate their practices. Black migrants contested the de facto segregation and the racial covenants that bolstered Chicago's race scale, which developed during the Great Migration on the city's south side. Tracking the shifts and fluctuations of Chicago's legal landscapes, this article stresses the agency of marginal men and women in the design and organization of the built environment in the industrial city.},

Urban economic restructuring, by most accounts, has left city officials with few choices other than to pursue corporate-centered economic development strategies emphasizing downtown-area commercial and residential growth. In Chicago, however, a corporate-center redevelopment strategy advanced by a coalition of downtown business leaders competed with a production-oriented strategy articulated by a coalition of neighborhood organizations, manufacturers, and labor. Centrally located industrial districts facing gentrification pressures became contested terrain, and manufacturers ultimately benefited from protective measures put in place by a sympathetic administration. This essay argues that urban economic restructuring is open-ended and politically contested. It concludes that a fuller appreciation of the contingency of urban economic development would help uncover viable regime types featuring governing coalitions that include both community-based organizations and neighborhood business establishments.},

This article addresses two questions of the significant transformation in San Francisco's planning history: (1) how did the transformation occur? and (2) what were the transformative themes?

By exploring the literature on resident attitudes toward tourism development, this article examines (1) resident attitudes toward tourism in relation to socioeconomic factors; (2) spatial factors; (3) economic dependency; (4) resident and community typologies; (5) measuring residents' attitudes tourism development; and (6) theoretical perspectives such as community attachment, social exchange theory, and growth machine theory.

Outlets are now commonplace in many communities across America. Accused by many of predatory practices, payday lenders can be viewed as financial hazards in already economically distressed communities. Using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and associated statistical analyses, this paper examines the social ecology of payday lending along the Front Range communities of Colorado. Comparison of means and logistic regression results reveal how communities' composition by class, occupation, race/ethnicity, nativity, age, and military affiliation affect their likelihood of hosting payday lending.},

But many of the resultant strategies do little ``strategic work'' in the sense of shaping future development trajectories. This paper reviews the meaning of ``strategic work'' in terms of mobilising attention to an urban area as a whole, and influencing the way that multiple actors involved in urban development shape their interventions. It emphasises the key judgements which those involved in promoting such strategic work have to make and discusses how the capacity for making such judgements may be cultivated among individuals, groups, and the wider political community involved in urban governance.},

Survey and interview research examines the ways women in suburban NU neighborhoods of Minneapolis\textendash{}St. Paul interact with the built environment to effect divisions of household labor and social isolation. The analysis shows that women use pedestrian-accessible mixed-use centers and neo-traditional design features (e.g., porches) to lessen the burden of domestic labor and foster social interaction. Despite these affordances, the paper argues that NU neighborhoods do not ultimately serve as resources in breaking patterns of social segregation or women's isolation in suburbia.},

@article{currid_how_2007-1,
  title = {How {{Art}} and {{Culture Happen}} in {{New York}}},
  volume = {73},
  issn = {01944363},
  abstract = {Problem: In the last two decades, urban economic development has shifted its focus from industrial recruitment to talent and human capital, including art and culture. Many have argued that talented people are drawn to artistic and cultural amenities, but few have examined art and culture as a production system and drawn meaningful insights for urban planning and economic development based on understanding its inner workings. Purpose: This article looks closely at the mechanisms that structure and drive the cultural economy and suggests possible avenues for cultural economic development and policymaking based on these mecha- nisms. I focus on the ways cultural producers obtain jobs, advance their careers, gain value for their goods and services, and interact with each other. Methods: I conducted 80 interviews with cultural producers, cultural gatekeepers, and owners and managers of entertainment venues these groups frequent. Results and conclusions: I find that not only are artistic and cultural producers densely agglomerated, but that key social mechanisms structure and inform this clustered production system. These in- dustries depend on unique kinds of social interaction, from nightlife to gallery open- ings, to thrive. This is more than just fun and games, and is critical to the operation of this economic sector. Takeaway for practice: Cultural pro- ducers rely heavily on their social lives to advance their careers, obtain jobs, and gen- erate value for their goods, so that the local arts social milieu is critical to the cultural economy. Cultural producers also tend to cross-fertilize, collaborating to create goods and services, review each other's products, and establish new careers, meaning the ability to live and work in close proximity to one another is important. Finally, a large concentration of creative people and an active cultural milieu has made New York culture a known brand. While New York is unique, the cultural life of other cities and regions can also be economic development assets. Places can strategically cultivate the social milieus that are most conducive to the production of art and culture.},

Using a natural experimental design, it investigates the impact of street cleaning on car usage for five hundred randomly selected households. Street cleaning encourages car usage for households without off-street parking and discourages car usage for households with off-street parking. The net effect is an increase of vehicle miles traveled by 7.1 percent, at least 27 percent of which is not a mere redistribution from non-street-cleaning days.},
